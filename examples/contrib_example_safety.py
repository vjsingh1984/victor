"""Example safety extension using victor.contrib.

This file demonstrates how to create a vertical-specific safety extension
using the BaseSafetyExtension from victor.contrib.safety.

This eliminates ~100+ lines of boilerplate code that would otherwise be
duplicated across verticals.

    This example shows how to:

    4. Implement get_vertical_rules() to define vertical-specific rules
    5. Use helper methods to create common safety patterns

    The base classes provide:
    - Automatic coordinator initialization

    - Statistics tracking
    - Vertical context tracking
