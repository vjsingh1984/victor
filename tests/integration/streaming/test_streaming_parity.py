"""Streaming-loop characterization battery — the FEP-0007 regression gate.

These tests pin the canonical streaming loop (``StreamingChatExecutor.run()`` driving the unified
``_stream_turn()`` primitive) on the QA battery: each scenario must yield the expected answer +
tool sequence with no streaming traceback. There is a single streaming path — no feature flag and
no legacy fallback — so these characterization transcripts ARE the regression gate: any refactor of
the loop (e.g. the Phase 2 helper extractions and the ``_stream_turn`` assembly) must keep them
byte-stable.
