"""Run/stream behavioral-parity battery — the FEP-0007 unified-loop gate.

Addendum A (framing B) makes streaming a pure I/O mode of the one research-rooted loop:
``Agent.run(p)`` (buffered ``AgenticLoop.run``) and ``Agent.stream(p)`` (streaming, now
``AgenticLoop.run_streaming`` via ``StreamingChatExecutor.run_unified``) drive the SAME
PERCEIVE/PLAN/ACT/EVALUATE/DECIDE loop and differ only in I/O. So they must produce the SAME
executed tool sequence and the SAME answer for each QA scenario. This battery drives BOTH real
loops from one scripted script and asserts that parity across the whole battery.

History: before the step-3 cutover the two loops diverged on multi-step tasks — but that was a
latent ``run()`` bug (a tool-only turn's empty content fell through to a ``CompletionResponse``
object and crashed the content-repetition check), not PPAED eagerness. With the cutover (streaming
driving the unified loop) and that bug fixed, all scenarios reach parity.
