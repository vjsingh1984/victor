"""Placeholder for missing vertical capability warning test."""

# TODO: Implement proper test for missing vertical capability warning
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
# - Verify that when --vertical <name> is specified and the vertical is not installed,
#   the system emits:
#   1. A structured warning message to the user
#   2. A "missing_vertical" usage analytics event
#   3. A "capabilities.vertical.missing" observability event
#
# CHALLENGES:
# - Test isolation: Bootstrap happens during module imports, not during test execution
# - Monkeypatch timing: Services are created before monkeypatches can be applied
# - Container lifecycle: Need to properly isolate container between tests
#
# PROPER IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
# 1. Use pytest fixtures with explicit container setup/teardown
# 2. Inject services via container.register() instead of monkeypatching
# 3. Mock at protocol level (UsageLoggerProtocol) not implementation level
# 4. Use CliRunner in a subprocess with fresh Python interpreter
# 5. Or: Test the _report_capability_health() function directly without full CLI bootstrap
#
# REFERENCE:
# - See docs/architecture/rl_database_architecture.md for database architecture
# - See victor/core/bootstrap.py:_report_capability_health for implementation
