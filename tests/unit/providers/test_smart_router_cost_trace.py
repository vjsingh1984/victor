"""L4: cost/latency-aware routing — the cost factor honors the C0 per-turn cost trace.

When the recent per-turn record (TaskExecutionReport) shows turns are expensive or slow, the
cost score biases toward cheaper/faster local providers; without a trace the static profile
preference is used unchanged.
