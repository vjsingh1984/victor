"""Regression tests: intermediate provider stream wrappers must cascade close.

A stream wrapper that re-yields `async for chunk in inner: yield chunk` without
`contextlib.aclosing(inner)` does NOT finalize the inner generator when the wrapper itself
is aclosed on an early consumer break (aclose does not cascade GeneratorExit into a
sub-generator iterated via `async for`). That left the underlying httpx byte stream
suspended and finalized off-task by GC — the source of "async generator ignored
GeneratorExit" / "exit cancel scope in a different task" warnings every turn.
