"""ZAI (z.ai GLM) prompt-caching contract tests.

Encodes the caching contract for the ZAIProvider, grounded in Z.AI's official
context-caching documentation (``docs.z.ai/guides/capabilities/cache.md``):

Contract under test:
1. ZAIProvider.supports_prompt_caching() == True
   Z.AI provides implicit, automatic context caching for GLM-5/4.7/4.6/4.5
   series models. Cached tokens are billed at a discounted rate (~50% of the
   standard price) and reported via ``usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens``.
2. ZAIProvider.supports_kv_prefix_caching() == True
   The inference engine reuses precomputed KV state for identical leading
   prefixes (system prompt + tools), reducing time-to-first-token.

These flags gate the framework's KV-optimization chain
(``_kv_optimization_enabled`` in ``prompt_builder_runtime.py``), which freezes
the turn-1 tool set and deterministically orders ``tools[]`` so the serialized
prefix hashes identically across turns, maximizing cache hits.
