"""Tests for benchmark failure-diagnosis logging (agent_adapter + harness).

Covers the gaps that made benchmark failures undiagnosable:
- `_record_tool_failure` now logs the full error text (was only hashed).
- `_file_modifying_tools()` recognizes the real tool names ``edit``/``write``
  (was only legacy aliases → files_modified always False after an edit).
  (#368 replaced the `_FILE_MODIFYING_TOOLS` constant with this derivation:
  CORE AccessMode.WRITE metadata unioned with a curated fallback.)
