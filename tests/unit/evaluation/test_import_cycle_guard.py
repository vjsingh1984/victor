    Importing any ``victor.framework.*`` runs framework's heavy ``__init__``,
    which pulls in the agent runtime and loops back into the half-initialised
    evaluation module — a circular ``ImportError`` that broke
    ``import victor.evaluation.*`` (and the offline calibration runner) whenever
    evaluation was imported before the framework. The shared type now lives in
    ``victor_contracts``; this test runs the import in a *fresh* interpreter
    (where framework is not already loaded by an earlier test) to ensure the
    cycle does not return.
