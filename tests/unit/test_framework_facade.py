"""Tests for Phase 9 Framework Facades.

These tests verify that the facade modules correctly re-export components
from the underlying modules and that the exports are identical objects
(not copies), ensuring the Facade Pattern is correctly implemented.

The facade pattern provides:
1. Single import point for framework users
2. No code duplication - pure re-exports
3. Backward compatibility with original modules
