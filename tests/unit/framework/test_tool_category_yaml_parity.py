"""Guard: the ToolCategory enum and tool_categories.yaml are consistent views.

The ``ToolCategory`` enum is the single identity authority for category *names*.
``tool_categories.yaml`` is a derived view that supplies membership / descriptions
/ presets but may only name categories that exist in the enum. These tests pin the
two vocabularies equal so the historical drift (the YAML declared ``notebook`` /
``task_management`` / ``verification`` while the enum did not, so they were silently
dropped from the built-in fallback) cannot reappear.
