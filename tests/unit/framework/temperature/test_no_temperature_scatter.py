"""Boundary guard (ADR-013, PR-E): no NEW raw temperature arithmetic outside the sanctioned modules.

The unified temperature policy consolidated 6 scattered paths into one resolver. This AST guard keeps
it that way: any ``<…temperature…> +/- <number>`` expression must live in
``victor/framework/temperature/`` or the recovery escalation modules (the latter pending absorption
into the resolver). A new file doing ad-hoc temperature math fails this test — preventing a 7th scatter.
