"""Regression tests for the policy ASK approval-handler container-swap bug.

A chat UI used to register its interactive approval handler into the *global* DI
container during ``on_chat_start``. The first turn then bootstrapped a fresh container
and disposed the previous global — orphaning the handler — so the policy middleware
resolved ``PolicyApprovalHandler`` as ``None`` and every ASK-gated tool hit
``ask_fallback`` (deny). The fix moves registration onto ``VictorClient``, which registers
into the container it actually builds (after bootstrap, before ``Agent.create``).

The existing ``test_builder_wiring.py`` uses a fake container and cannot catch this; these
tests drive the real ``bootstrap_container`` → ``set_container`` swap and the real
``VictorClient._ensure_initialized`` path.
