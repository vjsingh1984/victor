"""tool-supply P8 — the ACT pipeline is an explicit ordered stage list (byte-identical).

Empirical evidence that the refactor of the procedural pile into a declared pipeline
preserves stage order, applies every transform, and records each stage in the trace.
Shipped on by default (no flag): the existing order/arg/output-pinning runtime suite
plus these tests are the parity gate.
