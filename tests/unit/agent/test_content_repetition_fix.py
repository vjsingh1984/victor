"""Tests for content repetition detection and loop exit fixes.

P0 Issues Fixed:
1. Content Repetition Loop - High overlap detection now forces completion earlier
2. Tool Call Extraction Failures - Lower confidence threshold and improved patterns
3. Loop Detection Forces Early Completion - Proper exit with forced_stop flag
4. Forced Tool Execution Loop - Faster exit after 2 failed attempts (down from 3)
