"""Regression tests for decision session_id propagation (FEP-0012 spine).

Root cause these guard against: decisions logged during a task got an EMPTY
session_id (~90% of stage_detection/task_completion rows) because the
session_id contextvar set by the caller didn't reach the agentic loop's
decision-logging context (lost across async/thread boundaries). The fix:
the benchmark adapter stamps ``orchestrator.active_session_id`` and
``orchestrator.chat()`` re-stamps the contextvar from it, so every decision
the loop logs carries the task's session_id — and ``record_session_outcome``
can join them.
