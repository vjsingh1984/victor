"""Import boundary guard tests for chat and tool subservices.

Migration Note (2026-05-01):
- victor/agent/services/chat/* subservices removed (unused parallel architecture)
- victor/agent/services/tools/* subservices removed (unused parallel architecture)
- Canonical ChatService is in victor/agent/services/chat_service.py
- Canonical ToolService is in victor/agent/services/tool_service.py
- Both chat/ and tools/ subdirectories were completely deleted

These tests prevent regression by ensuring no new internal code imports
from the removed subservice packages.
