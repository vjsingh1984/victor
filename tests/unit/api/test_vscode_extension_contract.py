"""Contract test: the VS Code extension's REST client vs the FastAPI backend routes.

The extension (`vscode-victor/src/victorClient.ts`) is a thin HTTP client over the
victor FastAPI server. This test extracts every endpoint the extension calls and
verifies it is registered on the FastAPI app, so the two can't silently drift apart.

The router factories only touch the server at request time, so the full route table is
built with a mock server (no orchestrator / live server needed).
