"""Guard test for hotspot file regrowth (TD-14, TD-15).

TD-R1 decomposed the orchestrator to 3,510 lines, then it silently regrew to
4,690 by 2026-07 because nothing ratcheted it. This guard pins the audited
sizes of the known hotspot files so they can only shrink: raising a cap
requires editing this file and explaining why in review.

As decomposition work lands (TD-14 orchestrator, TD-15 services sprawl),
lower the caps to the new audited sizes.
