"""Guard test for directory naming consistency (singular vs plural packages).

Enforces the repository's package-naming convention by rejecting *new*
same-parent singular/plural directory collisions — e.g. a parent that contains
both ``foo/`` and ``foos/`` for the same concept. This is the exact drift that
once produced ``tests/benchmark/`` alongside ``tests/benchmarks/`` and
``victor/integrations/protocol/`` alongside ``victor/integrations/protocols/``.

Naming convention (authoritative statement — this test is the source of truth):
  1. Top-level packages and their ``tests/`` mirrors are **plural** when they
     hold a collection of modules (``victor/tools``, ``victor/providers``,
     ``victor/protocols``, ``victor/verticals``, ``tests/unit/tools`` ...).
     A test directory mirrors its source package name *exactly*.
  2. **Singular** is reserved for a sub-package that describes one concrete
     subsystem or whose name is a proper/mass noun
     (``victor/benchmark`` the vertical, ``mode_config``, ``profiler``).
  3. A *category* test directory that is NOT a package mirror uses a descriptive
     name, not the bare noun (``tests/performance``, not ``tests/benchmark``).
  4. A parent directory MUST NOT contain both the singular and the plural form
     of the same concept. If two distinct concepts share a stem, rename one so
     the intent is unambiguous (e.g. ``agents/`` meaning multi-agent -> ``multi_agent/``).

This guard only flags same-parent pairs. Cross-layer splits where singular and
plural describe genuinely different things at different layers
(e.g. ``victor/agent/conversation`` the runtime store vs
``victor/framework/conversations`` the coordination framework) are NOT same-parent
and are therefore allowed; the distinction is documented, not mechanical.
