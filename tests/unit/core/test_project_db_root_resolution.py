"""Project database root resolution (walk-up to the owning project).

Regression coverage for the bug where querying a *subdirectory* (e.g. graph
analytics scoped to ``src/network``) resolved to a fresh empty
``src/network/.victor/project.db`` instead of the repository's real
``<root>/.victor/project.db`` — which made broad graph modes report the database
as "unavailable" and littered stray ``.victor/`` directories through the tree.
