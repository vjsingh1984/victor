"""Meta-tests guarding global-database isolation for the unit-test suite.

Production ``~/.victor/victor.db`` was found polluted with unit-test RL
fixtures (``failing_tool``, ``123invalid``, ``nonexistent_tool``,
``timed_tool`` — 12,035 ``rl_tool_outcome`` rows): tests that exercised the
RL store wrote through ``victor.core.database.get_database()`` straight into
the developer's real global database.

The session-scoped autouse fixture ``isolate_global_victor_db``
(tests/unit/conftest.py) sandboxes ``$HOME`` so ``DatabaseManager`` resolves
its ``Path.home()/.victor/victor.db`` path inside a throwaway temp dir. These
tests are the regression net for that fixture: if it is ever removed, renamed,
or stops taking effect, they fail loudly BEFORE the suite silently resumes
polluting the real database.

Ordering note: the pure path checks run first and import nothing from victor,
so running this file without conftest fixtures (the "red" state) fails on the
path assertions without ever opening — let alone writing — the real database.
