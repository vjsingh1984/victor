"""FEP-0014 guard: no NEW duplicate ValidationSeverity / ValidationResult.

The canonical ``ValidationSeverity`` and ``ValidationResult`` live in
``victor/core/validation.py``. This guard scans every ``victor/**/*.py`` module for
class definitions with those names and fails if one appears anywhere other than the
canonical module OR the explicit ALLOWLIST of already-known duplicates.

The allowlist captures the divergent definitions that FEP-0014 Phase 2 will migrate
onto the canonical types. It **shrinks toward empty** as each consumer is migrated;
when Phase 3 removes the last shim the allowlist is empty and this guard enforces a
single source of truth going forward. The test PASSES today (allowlist covers the
known duplicates) and FAILS the moment a *new* duplicate is introduced.
