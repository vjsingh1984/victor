"""tool-supply P7 follow-on — pattern_registry.TaskType collapses onto the registry.

The largest task-type adapter (``victor.classification.pattern_registry.TaskType``)
was deferred from the first P7 pass because it carries vertical-scoped/specialized
members (kubernetes, terraform, data_profiling, …). This battery pins its
``to_canonical()`` / ``from_canonical()`` adapter against the single
``TaskTypeRegistry`` authority: every member must resolve to a type registered as
either a core type or a vertical override — no orphans.
