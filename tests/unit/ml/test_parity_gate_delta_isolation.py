"""FEP-0012 Phase 6 ship-bar guard: the parity gate must not read the per-project
delta.

``victor ml validate`` (the task_completion parity ship bar) trains/evaluates the
*universal* artifact from the global ``decision_outcome`` junction only. The
per-project ``local_classifier_delta`` is additive and must stay invisible to the
gate so shipping the delta loop cannot regress the parity decision. This is a
static source guard so it runs in every CI shard (no sklearn/data needed).
