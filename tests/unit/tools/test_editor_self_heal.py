"""FileEditor backup self-heal — regression for the benchmark edit-commit P0.

Root cause: the FileEditor is a long-lived singleton whose backup_dir is mkdir'd
once at __init__. The SWE-bench harness runs `git clean -fd` between tasks,
which deletes the workspace's `.victor/` (untracked) — including the backup_dir.
The next edit's `_create_backup` then does `shutil.copy2` into a non-existent
dir → FileNotFoundError → the whole commit rolls back → every later edit fails.

Fix: `_create_backup` re-ensures the backup_dir exists before each copy.
