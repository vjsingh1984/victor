"""Tests for the edit tool's backslash-normalized match fallback.

Reproduces the real benchmark failure (astropy-14182, qdp.py): the agent's
old_str had double-escaped backslashes (``\\\\d`` from JSON) while the file had
single (``\\d``) → exact match failed → no patch → task failed. The fallback
normalizes ``\\\\d`` → ``\\d`` and retries.
