"""Description-contract guard tests (Tool Reliability P9).

Telemetry mining (13 days, 4,612 tool results) showed the top tool-error
causes are avoidable first-call mistakes the LLM makes because the tool
description does not warn against them (grep-style flags to ``code``,
porcelain flags to ``git``, readonly-pinned ``shell`` calls, type-less
``edit`` ops, argument-less ``write``). The fixes fold each lesson into the
docstring that reaches the model via the ``@tool`` decorator.

These tests are the cheap regression net: each tool's LLM-facing description
must keep its load-bearing phrase so future docstring edits don't silently
drop the lesson. Phrases whose docstring changes land in other PRs of the
release train (R3/R4/R5) are marked ``xfail(strict=False)`` with a TODO to
tighten once the train merges.
