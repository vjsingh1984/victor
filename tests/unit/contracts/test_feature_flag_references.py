"""CI guard: every referenced FeatureFlag must still exist in the enum.

Prevents regressions where a flag is removed from the enum while code elsewhere
in the monorepo (notably the vendored verticals under ``verticals/`` and
``victor-contracts/``, which a root-only audit easily misses) still references it
via ``FeatureFlag.<NAME>`` — e.g. ``USE_GRAPH_RAG`` / ``USE_MULTI_HOP_RETRIEVAL``
are read by ``verticals/victor-coding/.../code_search_tool.py``. Removing such a
flag makes the reference raise ``AttributeError`` at runtime (a latent breakage
unit tests don't catch unless they exercise that path).

Scans ``victor/``, ``verticals/``, and ``victor-contracts/`` for
``FeatureFlag.<NAME>`` references and asserts each NAME is a real enum member.
