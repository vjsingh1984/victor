"""Guard: memory RelationType code-relations must match the graph EdgeType vocabulary.

The CALLS / DATA_DEP / CONTROL_DEP relation values are intentionally UPPERCASE because
they mirror the canonical program-analysis edge types the graph index emits and that
graph/code_search edge filters match on. If they drift (e.g. someone "normalizes" them to
lowercase for consistency with the semantic relations), tree-sitter graphrag relations
would silently stop matching edge-type-filtered graph queries. This test locks the
alignment so that regression is caught at test time.
