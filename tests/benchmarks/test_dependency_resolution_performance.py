"""Performance benchmarks for dependency resolution.

These benchmarks validate that the ExtensionDependencyGraph meets
the performance target of < 10ms for dependency resolution.

Target Metrics:
    - Dependency resolution: < 10ms
    - Topological sort performance
    - Circular dependency detection speed
