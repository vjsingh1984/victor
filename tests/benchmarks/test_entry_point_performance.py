"""Performance benchmarks for entry point scanning.

These benchmarks validate that the UnifiedEntryPointRegistry meets
the performance target of < 50ms for single-pass scanning.

Target Metrics:
    - Entry point scan: < 50ms
    - Single-pass scanning vs multiple independent scans
    - Lazy loading efficiency
