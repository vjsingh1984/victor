"""Query compilation harness.

Discovers every registered language plugin and verifies that every non-empty
tree-sitter query string it ships compiles against its grammar. Mirrors the
spirit of VS Code Copilot's centralized ``allKnownQueries`` registration.

A failure here usually means a grammar wheel updated and the plugin's queries
need a corresponding update, or a plugin shipped an invalid query.
