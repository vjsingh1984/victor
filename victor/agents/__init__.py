"""Agent definition and ensemble orchestration system.

Victor's agent system uses a protocol-based, composable DSL inspired by:
- Prefect/Airflow: Task DAG composition
- Kubernetes: Declarative YAML specifications
- Pydantic: Type-safe validation
- Protocol-oriented design: Behavior contracts over inheritance

Key Concepts:
- AgentSpec: Declarative agent specification (YAML/JSON/Python)
- AgentCapabilities: What an agent can do (tools, skills)
- AgentConstraints: Limits and requirements (tokens, cost, time)
- Ensemble: Coordinated group of agents working together
- Pipeline: Sequential or parallel agent execution

Example (Python DSL):
    from victor.agents import AgentSpec, Ensemble, Pipeline

    researcher = AgentSpec(
        name="researcher",
        description="Gathers information and analyzes data",
        capabilities=["web_search", "code_search", "read_file"],
        model_preference="reasoning",  # Let system pick best model
    )

    coder = AgentSpec(
        name="coder",
        description="Writes and modifies code",
        capabilities=["edit_file", "write_file", "execute_bash"],
        model_preference="coding",
    )

    # Create a pipeline: research -> code
    pipeline = Pipeline([researcher, coder])
    result = await pipeline.execute(task="Add user authentication")

Example (YAML):
    agents:
      - name: researcher
        description: Gathers information
        capabilities: [web_search, code_search]

      - name: coder
        description: Writes code
        capabilities: [edit_file, write_file]

    ensemble:
      type: pipeline
      agents: [researcher, coder]
