"""A/B testing for workflow optimization.

This package provides A/B testing infrastructure for comparing different
workflow configurations.

Usage:
    from victor.experiments.ab_testing import (
        ABTestManager,
        ExperimentConfig,
        ExperimentVariant,
        WorkflowInterceptor,
    )

    # Create manager
    manager = ABTestManager()

    # Create experiment
    config = ExperimentConfig(
        name="Model Comparison",
        variants=[
            ExperimentVariant(
                variant_id="control",
                name="Claude Sonnet",
                traffic_weight=0.5,
            ),
            ExperimentVariant(
                variant_id="treatment",
                name="Claude Opus",
                traffic_weight=0.5,
            ),
        ],
    )
    experiment_id = await manager.create_experiment(config)
    await manager.start_experiment(experiment_id)

    # Use interceptor
    interceptor = WorkflowInterceptor(manager)
    result = await interceptor.execute_with_experiment(
        workflow_func=execute_workflow,
        experiment_id=experiment_id,
        user_id="user_123",
        context={},
    )
