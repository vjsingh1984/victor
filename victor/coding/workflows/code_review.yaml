            Perform a detailed code review focusing on:

            1. **Logic and Correctness**
               - Are there any bugs or logic errors?
               - Are edge cases handled?
               - Are error conditions properly managed?

            2. **Code Quality**
               - Is the code readable and maintainable?
               - Are functions/methods appropriately sized?
               - Is there code duplication?

            3. **Best Practices**
               - Does it follow project conventions?
               - Are design patterns used appropriately?
               - Is there proper separation of concerns?

            4. **Performance**
               - Are there obvious performance issues?
               - Any N+1 queries or expensive loops?
               - Memory usage concerns?

            5. **Testing**
               - Are changes adequately tested?
               - Are test cases meaningful?
               - Is coverage sufficient?

               - Are there breaking changes?
               - How many files/functions are modified?

            2. **Dependency Analysis**
               - What depends on the modified code?
               - Could changes break existing functionality?
               - Are there circular dependencies introduced?

            3. **Risk Assessment**
               - Identify high-risk changes
               - Check for potential regressions
               - Flag changes to critical paths

               - Is coverage adequate?

            2. **New Tests**
               - Were tests added for new functionality?
               - Do new tests follow project conventions?
               - Are edge cases covered?

            3. **Test Quality**
