"""Rust token counter wrapper.

Provides a protocol-compliant wrapper around the Rust BPE tokenizer.
The wrapper delegates to victor_native functions while maintaining
the TokenCounterProtocol interface.

Performance characteristics:
- count_tokens: 2-5x faster (Rust BPE implementation)
- count_tokens_batch: crosses the FFI boundary ONCE via the native
  ``count_tokens_fast_batch`` (rayon-parallel), instead of looping the
  single-text entry point from Python (which crossed once per text).
  Falls back to the per-element loop when the batch symbol is absent
  (older native builds), per the graceful-degradation mandate.
