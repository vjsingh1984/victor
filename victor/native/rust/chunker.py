"""Rust text chunker wrapper.

Provides a protocol-compliant wrapper around the Rust line-aware chunking
functions. The wrapper delegates to victor_native functions while maintaining
the TextChunkerProtocol interface.

Performance characteristics:
- count_lines: 5-10x faster (SIMD byte counting)
- find_line_boundaries: 3-5x faster (single pass)
- chunk_with_overlap: 3-5x faster (pre-computed line boundaries)
