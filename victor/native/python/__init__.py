"""Pure Python fallback implementations for native accelerations.

These implementations serve as:
1. Reference implementations for testing
2. Fallbacks when Rust extensions are not compiled
3. Documentation of expected behavior

All implementations follow the protocols defined in victor.native.protocols.
