"""Research Tool Dependencies - Tool relationships for research workflows.

Migrated to YAML-based configuration for declarative tool dependency management.
Configuration is loaded from tool_dependencies.yaml in this directory.

Uses canonical tool names from ToolNames to ensure consistent naming
across RL Q-values, workflow patterns, and vertical configurations.

The YAML-based approach provides:
- Declarative configuration that's easier to read and modify
- Consistent schema validation via Pydantic
- Automatic tool name canonicalization
- Caching for performance

For backward compatibility, the legacy constants are preserved and derived
from the YAML configuration at import time.

        This class is maintained for backward compatibility.

    Extends YAMLToolDependencyProvider to load research-specific tool
    relationships from tool_dependencies.yaml.

    Provides configurations for:
    - Fact-checking workflows
    - Literature review workflows
    - Technical lookup workflows
    - Report writing workflows

    Uses tool names from ToolNames constants for consistency.

    Example:
        # Preferred (new code):
        from victor.core.tool_dependency_loader import create_vertical_tool_dependency_provider
        provider = create_vertical_tool_dependency_provider("research")

        # Deprecated (backward compatible):
        provider = ResearchToolDependencyProvider()

    Note: canonicalize=False is used to preserve the original tool names
    as defined in the YAML (e.g., code_search vs grep). The tool names
    in the YAML match the ToolNames constants used in the original Python.
