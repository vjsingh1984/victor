"""Research vertical workflows.

This package provides workflow definitions for common research tasks:
- Deep research with source verification
- Fact-checking
- Literature review
- Competitive analysis

Uses YAML-first architecture with Python escape hatches for complex conditions
and transforms that cannot be expressed in YAML.

Example:
    provider = ResearchWorkflowProvider()

    # Compile and execute (recommended - uses UnifiedWorkflowCompiler with caching)
    result = await provider.run_compiled_workflow("deep_research", {"query": "AI trends"})

    # Stream execution with real-time progress
    async for node_id, state in provider.stream_compiled_workflow("deep_research", context):
        print(f"Completed: {node_id}")

Available workflows (all YAML-defined):
- deep_research: Comprehensive research with source validation
- quick_research: Fast research for simple queries
- fact_check: Systematic fact verification
- literature_review: Academic literature review
- competitive_analysis: Market and competitive research
- competitive_scan: Quick competitive overview
