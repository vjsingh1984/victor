"""Per-turn tool-supply telemetry.

Records how the *registered* tool set is narrowed to the tools the model actually
receives, stage by stage, so over-restriction becomes observable. Today the only
signal is a single ``logger.info`` line in the selection runtime, which cannot
answer "which gate dropped ``code_search`` this turn?". A :class:`ToolSupplyTrace`
captures that funnel and is emitted once per turn on the observability bus under
the :data:`TOOL_SUPPLY_TOPIC` topic (mirroring the existing ``tool.intent`` event).

This module is pure data + a thin builder. It performs no selection and changes no
behavior; it only observes the existing pipeline.
