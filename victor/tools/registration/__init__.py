"""Tool registration strategy pattern.

This package provides an extensible tool registration system that follows
the Open/Closed Principle (OCP). New tool types can be added without
modifying existing code by registering new strategies.

Architecture:
    ToolRegistrationStrategy (Protocol)
        ├── FunctionDecoratorStrategy
        ├── BaseToolSubclassStrategy
        └── MCPDictStrategy

    ToolRegistrationStrategyRegistry
        └── Manages strategy selection and registration

Usage:
    # Add a custom tool type without modifying core code
    class PydanticModelStrategy:
        def can_handle(self, tool):
            return isinstance(tool, BaseModel)

        def register(self, registry, tool, enabled=True):
            wrapper = self._create_wrapper(tool)
            registry._register_direct(wrapper.name, wrapper, enabled)

    # Register the strategy
    registry = ToolRegistry()
    registry.add_custom_strategy(PydanticModelStrategy())

    # Now you can register Pydantic models as tools
    registry.register(MyPydanticModel)
