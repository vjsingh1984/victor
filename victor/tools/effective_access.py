"""Per-invocation effective access-mode resolution.

Static :class:`~victor.tools.metadata.ToolMetadata` declares a tool's
*capability envelope* (shell CAN execute, code CAN run tests). Multi-command
tools are therefore classified write-capable even when a specific invocation
is a pure read (``shell readonly=True``, ``code grep …``) — which over-fires
pre-tool checkpoints and renders misleading write badges in the CLI.

This module resolves the access mode of one concrete invocation from its
arguments. Resolvers may only **narrow** the declared envelope (to READONLY),
never widen it, and any resolver failure falls back to the static metadata —
so safety-relevant consumers can trust the result is at most as permissive as
the declaration.

Consumers: agent-side tool categorization (checkpoint gating,
parallelization) and the CLI renderer (access badges).
