"""Tool composition utilities for lazy loading and efficient tool management.

This package provides utilities for composing tools:

LCEL-style Composition (from runnable.py):
- Runnable: Base class for composable runnables
- RunnableSequence: Sequential execution (pipe chaining)
- RunnableParallel: Parallel execution
- RunnableBranch: Conditional routing
- RunnableLambda: Wrap functions as runnables
- RunnablePassthrough: Pass input through unchanged
- RunnableBinding: Runnables with bound arguments
- ToolRunnable: Wrap BaseTool as Runnable
- FunctionToolRunnable: Wrap @tool functions as Runnable
- Helper functions: chain, parallel, branch, as_runnable
- Extractors: extract_output, extract_if_success, map_keys, select_keys

Lazy Tool Loading (from lazy.py):
- LazyToolRunnable: Defers tool initialization until first use
- ToolCompositionBuilder: Builder pattern for composing multiple tools

Example:
    >>> from victor.tools.composition import LazyToolRunnable, ToolCompositionBuilder
    >>>
    >>> # Lazy loading single tool
    >>> lazy_tool = LazyToolRunnable(lambda: ExpensiveTool(), name="expensive")
    >>> # Tool not created yet
    >>> result = lazy_tool.run({"input": "test"})  # Now created and cached
    >>>
    >>> # Building composed tools
    >>> builder = ToolCompositionBuilder()
    >>> tools = (
    ...     builder
    ...     .add("search", lambda: SearchTool(), lazy=True)
    ...     .add("analyze", lambda: AnalyzeTool(), lazy=True)
    ...     .build()
    ... )
