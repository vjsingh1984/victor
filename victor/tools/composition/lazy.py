"""Lazy tool composition utilities for efficient tool loading.

This module provides lazy-loading wrappers for tool composition, enabling
deferred initialization of expensive tools until their first use.

Key classes:
- LazyToolRunnable: Wraps a tool factory to defer instantiation
- ToolCompositionBuilder: Builder pattern for composing multiple lazy tools

Example:
    >>> from victor.tools.composition.lazy import LazyToolRunnable
    >>>
    >>> lazy = LazyToolRunnable(lambda: ExpensiveTool())
    >>> # Tool not created yet
    >>> result = lazy.run({"input": "test"})  # Now created and cached
"""

from functools import cached_property
from typing import Any, Optional
from collections.abc import Callable

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class LazyToolRunnable:
    """Lazy-loading wrapper for tool composition.

    Defers tool initialization until first use, reducing startup time
    for applications with many tools that may not all be needed.

    The underlying tool is created on first access to the `tool` property
    or when `run()`/`arun()` is called. Once created, the instance is
    cached (unless caching is disabled) for subsequent calls.

    Attributes:
        name: The name of the lazy tool (from factory or explicit)

    Example:
        >>> lazy = LazyToolRunnable(lambda: ExpensiveTool())
        >>> # Tool not created yet - no memory/resources used
        >>> result = lazy.run({"input": "test"})  # Now created
        >>> result2 = lazy.run({"input": "test2"})  # Uses cached instance
        >>>

        >>> print(lazy.name)  # "semantic_search"
