"""Severity weighting for codebase analysis issues.

This module calculates severity scores for issues based on their actual
impact on the codebase. Not all issues are equally severe - a cross-layer
dependency in core code is more critical than a style issue in tests.

P4 Priority: Medium impact, medium effort. Enables better prioritization.

Design Patterns:
- Weighted Scoring: Multiple factors contribute to severity
- Category-Based Impact: Different issue types have different impacts
- Configurable Weights: Weights can be customized per project

Usage:
    weighting = SeverityWeighting()
    score = weighting.calculate_severity_score({
        "issue_type": "cross_layer_dependency",
        "file_path": "src/core/lib.rs",
        "category": "architectural",
    })
    severity = weighting.classify_severity(score)
