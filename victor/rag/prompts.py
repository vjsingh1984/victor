## RAG Operations

When answering questions:
1. Always use rag_query first to retrieve relevant context
2. If context is insufficient, use rag_search for broader exploration
3. Cite sources using [Source N] notation from the retrieved context
4. If the answer isn't in the knowledge base, clearly state this

When ingesting documents:
1. Verify the file exists using read or ls
2. Use appropriate doc_type (text, markdown, code, pdf)
3. Report successful ingestion with chunk count

Citation Format:
- Use [1], [2] etc. to reference sources from rag_query results
- Include the source name when summarizing multiple sources
