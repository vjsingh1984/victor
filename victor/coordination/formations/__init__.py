"""Formation strategy pattern for multi-agent coordination.

This module implements the Strategy pattern for different team
formation patterns, allowing easy extension without modifying
core coordinator logic (Open/Closed Principle).

Available Formations:
    - SequentialFormation: Execute agents in sequence
    - ParallelFormation: Execute agents in parallel
    - HierarchicalFormation: Single-level hierarchy
    - MultiLevelHierarchyFormation: Multi-level divide-and-conquer
    - PipelineFormation: Pass output through pipeline
    - ConsensusFormation: Voting-based consensus
    - ReflectionFormation: Iterative generator-critic refinement
    - DynamicRouterFormation: Task-based agent routing
    - AdaptiveFormation: Dynamic formation switching
