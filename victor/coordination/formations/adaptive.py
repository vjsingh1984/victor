"""Adaptive formation for dynamic coordination strategy switching.

This module provides AdaptiveFormation, which monitors task execution
and dynamically switches between coordination strategies based on
performance metrics.

Formation Pattern:
    Adaptive Wrapper → (Orchestration | Hierarchy | Consensus | ...)

Adaptation Strategies:
    - PERFORMANCE: Switch based on execution time
    - ERROR_RATE: Switch based on error frequency
    - FEEDBACK: Switch based on quality feedback

Formation Cycle:
    1. OrchestrationFormation (baseline)
    2. HierarchyFormation (for large/complex tasks)
    3. ConsensusFormation (for high accuracy requirements)

SOLID Principles:
- SRP: Adaptation logic only
- OCP: Extensible via custom formation cycles
- LSP: Substitutable with other formations
- DIP: Depends on TeamContext and BaseFormationStrategy abstractions

Usage:
    from victor.coordination.formations.adaptive import AdaptiveFormation
    from victor.coordination.formations.base import TeamContext

    # Create adaptive formation
    formation = AdaptiveFormation(
        adaptation_strategy="performance",
        max_switches=3,
    )

    # Create context with agents
    context = TeamContext("team-1", "adaptive")
    context.set("agent1", agent1)
    context.set("agent2", agent2)

    # Execute with automatic formation switching
    results = await formation.execute(agents, context, task)

    # Check which formation was used
    print(f"Formation used: {results[0].metadata['current_formation']}")
    print(f"Switches made: {results[0].metadata['formation_switches']}")
