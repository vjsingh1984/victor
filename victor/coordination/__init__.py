"""Multi-agent coordination module.

This module provides formation strategies for multi-agent coordination,
without creating circular dependencies.

The coordination module is intentionally kept lightweight and independent:
- Formation strategies (sequential, parallel, hierarchical, pipeline, consensus)
- Base classes and protocols for coordination
- No dependency on teams module (breaks circular dependency)

Example:
    from victor.coordination.formations import SequentialFormation, ParallelFormation
    from victor.teams import UnifiedTeamCoordinator

    # Formations are used by coordinators, not the other way around
    coordinator = UnifiedTeamCoordinator()
    coordinator.set_formation(TeamFormation.SEQUENTIAL)
"""

# Re-export formation strategies for convenience
from victor.coordination.formations.base import (
    BaseFormationStrategy,
    TeamContext,
)
from victor.coordination.formations import (
    SequentialFormation,
    ParallelFormation,
    HierarchicalFormation,
    PipelineFormation,
    ConsensusFormation,
)
