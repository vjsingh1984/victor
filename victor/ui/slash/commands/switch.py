"""Switch command — deprecated, now handled by unified /model command.

The /switch command is absorbed into /model via the "switch" alias.
This file is kept for backward compatibility but the SwitchCommand class
is no longer registered. The ModelCommand in model.py handles all
switching functionality including --resume support.
"""

# NOTE: SwitchCommand is no longer registered.
# /switch is handled by ModelCommand via aliases=["models", "switch"]
# in victor/ui/slash/commands/model.py
