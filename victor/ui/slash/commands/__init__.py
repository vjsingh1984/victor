- session: save, load, sessions, resume, compact
- model: model, profile, provider
- tools: tools, context, lmstudio, mcp
- navigation: directory, changes, snapshots, commit
- mode: mode, build, explore, plan
- metrics: cost, metrics, serialization, learning, mlstats
- codebase: reindex, review, init
- checkpoint: checkpoint (save, list, restore, diff, timeline)

Commands are auto-discovered and registered when the slash module is loaded.
