"""Slash command handling for Victor CLI.

This module re-exports the modular slash command system from victor.ui.slash.

The implementation uses a SOLID-based, protocol-driven architecture that
enables easy addition of new commands without modifying existing code.

For adding new commands, see victor.ui.slash.commands/ for examples.
