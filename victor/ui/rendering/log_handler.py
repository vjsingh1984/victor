"""Live-display-aware console log handler.

During interactive chat a raw ``StreamHandler(sys.stderr)`` competes with the
Rich ``Live`` region: a log record emitted mid-frame tears the display, and
tool-execution errors end up rendered twice (raw log line + the renderer's
✗ error line). This handler routes console log output through the active Rich
console when a live display owns the screen — Rich prints it cleanly above
the live region — and behaves exactly like a plain stream handler otherwise
(headless, API server, tests).

The active live console is registered by :class:`LiveDisplayRenderer` around
its display lifecycle. Records tagged ``victor_category="tool_execution"``
(see ``ErrorHandler._log_error``) are dropped while a live display is active,
because the renderer already surfaces those as error cards; with no live
display they still reach the stream unchanged.
