"""Victor web chat UI — a Chainlit surface bound to :class:`VictorClient`.

This is a pure-Python, agent-native chat surface (beyond the terminal). It binds to
``VictorClient.stream()`` in-process (no HTTP bridge) and renders Victor's event model
(CONTENT / THINKING / TOOL_CALL / TOOL_RESULT) as streamed tokens and collapsible steps.

Launch with ``victor ui`` (requires the optional ``chat-ui`` extra: ``pip install
'victor-ai[chat-ui]'``). The event→render mapping lives in :mod:`event_mapping` and is
Chainlit-free so it can be unit-tested without the UI dependency installed.
