"""Helpful command resolution for the Victor CLI.

Typer/Click default to a bare ``No such command 'X'.`` when a command name is
unknown, and only ever suggest matches among a group's *direct* children. That
hides genuinely available commands from users: ``victor vacuum`` fails even
though ``victor db vacuum`` exists, and typos like ``victor hwlp`` get no
guidance.

``SuggestingGroup`` overrides command resolution to fuzzy-match the attempted
name against both top-level commands and one level of nested subcommands, then
emits a ``Did you mean 'victor db vacuum'?`` hint.
