"""Unified classification module for task type and complexity detection.

This module consolidates pattern matching and classification logic that was
previously duplicated between TaskTypeClassifier and TaskComplexityService.

Architecture (SOLID compliant):
- pattern_registry.py: Single source of truth for all classification patterns
- protocols.py: Interfaces for classifier components (DIP compliance)
- nudge_engine.py: Post-classification edge case corrections (SRP)

Usage:
    from victor.classification import PATTERNS, ClassificationPattern, NudgeEngine
    from victor.classification.protocols import TaskClassifierProtocol
