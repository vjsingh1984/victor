# Stage Keywords Configuration
#
# This file defines keywords used to classify conversation stages.
# Edit this file to customize stage detection for your workflow.
#
# Stages represent the current phase of a coding conversation:
# - INITIAL: Starting a new task
# - EXPLORING: Investigating the codebase
# - ANALYZING: Understanding problems/requirements
# - IMPLEMENTING: Writing/modifying code
# - REVIEWING: Reviewing changes/code quality
#
# Keywords are matched case-insensitively against user messages.
# Score is accumulated for each matching keyword.
