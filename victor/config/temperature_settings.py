"""Settings for the unified temperature policy (ADR-013).

Ops-tunable knobs for ``victor.framework.temperature``: the global fallback, a per-task default table
(an alternative to per-profile ``temperatures``), and the spin-ratchet parameters. Defaults match
``framework/temperature/defaults`` so behaviour is identical whether or not this group is customised.
