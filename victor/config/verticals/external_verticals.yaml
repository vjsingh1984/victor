# External Vertical Configuration for Air-Gapped Environments
#
# This file enables plugin discovery in air-gapped environments where Python
# entry points are not available. External verticals can be registered here
# as a fallback when VICTOR_AIRGAPPED=true.
#
# Phase 3 OCP Compliance:
# This YAML-based plugin registration follows the Open/Closed Principle by
# allowing verticals to be added without modifying core code.
#
# Usage in Air-Gapped Mode:
#   export VICTOR_AIRGAPPED=true
#   victor  # Will load verticals from this YAML file
#
# Format:
#   verticals:
#     - name: vertical_name
#       module: python.module.path
#       class: VerticalClassName
#       display_name: "Display Name"
#       description: "Vertical description"

verticals:
  # Example external vertical (commented out)
  # - name: security
  #   module: victor_security.verticals
  #   class: SecurityAssistant
  #   display_name: "Security Analysis"
  #   description: "Security vulnerability scanning and analysis"

  # Add your external verticals below following the format above
  # - name: your_vertical
  #   module: your_package.your_module
  #   class: YourVerticalClass
  #   display_name: "Your Vertical"
  #   description: "Description of your vertical"
