"""Event debouncing configuration to prevent log bloat.

This module provides settings for adaptive event debouncing, which filters
high-frequency duplicate events to prevent log bloat and improve performance.

        session_start_enabled: Enable debouncing for session_start events.
        session_start_window_type: Type of debouncing window (time_based, count_based, adaptive).

        session_start_max_per_window: Maximum events per time window.
        session_start_metadata_fingerprinting: Use metadata hash for semantic deduplication.
        session_start_track_lifecycle: Track session lifecycle for better deduplication.
        tool_intent_enabled: Enable debouncing for tool intent events.
