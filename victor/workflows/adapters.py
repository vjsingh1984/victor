"""Adapters for workflow engine interoperability.

This module provides adapters that bridge the gap between different
workflow engines in Victor:

1. WorkflowBuilder (victor/workflows) - DAG-based, dict context
2. StateGraph (victor/framework/graph.py) - Cyclic, typed state

The adapters enable unified execution while maintaining backward
compatibility with existing workflows.

Design Goals:
- Preserve existing WorkflowBuilder API
- Enable StateGraph features (cycles, typed state) for new workflows
- Single execution path for both workflow types
- Gradual migration from WorkflowBuilder to StateGraph

Usage:
    from victor.workflows.adapters import WorkflowToGraphAdapter

    # Adapt a WorkflowBuilder workflow to StateGraph
    adapter = WorkflowToGraphAdapter()
    state_graph = adapter.adapt(workflow_definition)

    # Execute with StateGraph runtime
    app = state_graph.compile()
    result = await app.invoke(initial_state)
