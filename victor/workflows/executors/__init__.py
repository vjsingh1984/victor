"""Node executors package.

Provides specialized executor classes for each workflow node type.
Each executor handles ONE node type (SRP compliance).

Executors:
- AgentNodeExecutor: Handles agent nodes (LLM + tools)
- ComputeNodeExecutor: Handles compute nodes (direct function calls)
- TransformNodeExecutor: Handles transform nodes (state transformations)
- ParallelNodeExecutor: Handles parallel nodes (concurrent execution)
- ConditionNodeExecutor: Handles condition nodes (branching logic)
- TeamStepExecutor: Handles declarative team steps (ad-hoc multi-agent teams)
- HITLNodeExecutor: Handles HITL nodes (resume-time metadata + result recording)
- Registry helpers: Support plugin/application registration of custom node types
