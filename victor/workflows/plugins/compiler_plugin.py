"""Base protocol for workflow compiler plugins.

This module defines the protocol that all workflow compiler plugins
must implement. Plugins provide extensible workflow compilation
from various sources (YAML, JSON, database, etc.).

    """Base class for workflow compiler plugins.

    All compiler plugins must implement this protocol. This provides
    a consistent interface for compiling workflows from various sources.

    Similar to SQLAlchemy's Dialect class.

    Plugins are registered by file extension (.yaml, .json, etc.) and
    optional URI schemes for remote locations (s3, http, etc.).

    Example:
        class YamlCompilerPlugin(WorkflowCompilerPlugin):
            def compile(self, source, **kwargs):
                # Load and compile YAML

            compiled = plugin.compile("workflow.yaml")
            result = await compiled.invoke({"input": "data"})
