"""Workflow compiler plugins.

This package provides plugin infrastructure for third-party verticals
to extend Victor's workflow compilation capabilities.

Purpose:
    Allow third-party packages to provide custom workflow compilers
    without modifying Victor's core code.

Example (Third-party package):
    # victor-security package
    from victor.workflows.plugins import WorkflowCompilerPlugin
    from victor.workflows.compiler_registry import register_compiler

    class SecurityCompilerPlugin(WorkflowCompilerPlugin):
        def compile(self, source, *, workflow_name=None, validate=True):
            # Security-specific compilation
            return self._compile_security_workflow(source)

    # Register plugin
    register_compiler("security", SecurityCompilerPlugin)

Usage:
    No built-in plugins are registered by default. Third-party packages
    should register their plugins during initialization.

    Built-in verticals use UnifiedWorkflowCompiler directly for YAML workflows.

    own initialization code.
