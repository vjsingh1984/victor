"""Dynamic workflow discovery - DIP-compliant workflow loading.

This module implements dynamic workflow discovery to eliminate
hardcoded workflow imports in the orchestrator.

Design Goals:
- Dependency Inversion: Orchestrator depends on abstractions, not concrete workflows
- Open/Closed: Add new workflows without modifying orchestrator
- Single Responsibility: Discovery logic centralized here

Usage:
    from victor.workflows.discovery import discover_workflows, register_builtin_workflows

    # Register all built-in workflows dynamically
    registry = WorkflowRegistry()
    register_builtin_workflows(registry)

    # Or discover from a package
    workflows = discover_workflows("victor.workflows")
