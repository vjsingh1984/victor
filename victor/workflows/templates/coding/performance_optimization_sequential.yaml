description: "Sequential performance analysis and optimization"
long_description: |
  A sequential team for systematic performance optimization. The team
  profiles code to identify bottlenecks, analyzes performance issues,
  implements optimizations, and verifies improvements. This ensures
  measurable, data-driven performance gains.

  Ideal for application optimization, bottleneck resolution, and efficiency improvements.
