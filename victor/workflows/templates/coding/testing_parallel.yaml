display_name: "Testing Team (Parallel)"
description: "Parallel test generation and execution team"
long_description: |
  A comprehensive testing team that generates and executes multiple test
  types in parallel. Four specialist testers create unit tests, integration
  tests, end-to-end tests, and property-based tests simultaneously,
  providing comprehensive coverage analysis.

  Ideal for test suite generation, coverage improvement, and test maintenance.
