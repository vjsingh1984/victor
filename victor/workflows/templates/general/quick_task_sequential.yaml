description: "Fast sequential task execution for simple tasks"
long_description: |
  A lightweight team for quick tasks. Two agents work sequentially: analyzer
  identifies what needs to be done, implementer makes the changes. Optimized
  for speed and simplicity.

  Ideal for quick fixes, simple updates, and routine maintenance.
