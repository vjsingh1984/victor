description: "Parallel research synthesis from multiple sources"
long_description: |
  A parallel team for comprehensive research synthesis. Four researchers
  analyze different aspects or sources independently, then results are
  merged into a coherent synthesis. This ensures thorough coverage and
  diverse perspectives.

  Ideal for research synthesis, report generation, and knowledge integration.
