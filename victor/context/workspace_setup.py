"""Workspace setup utilities for project dependency management.

Framework-level service that ensures a project workspace is properly
configured for tool execution. This includes:
- Auto-installing Python projects that need `pip install -e .`
- Detecting build system (setuptools, poetry, flit, hatch)
- Installing without heavy dependencies (--no-deps by default)

Used by:
- Benchmark harness (SWE-bench task evaluation)
- Orchestrator.set_workspace() (regular agentic workflows)
- Any tool that needs the project importable
