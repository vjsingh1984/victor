"""Unified message scoring for context management.

Single canonical scorer used by both ConversationController (runtime)
and ConversationStore (persistence). Replaces two separate scoring
implementations with one configurable function.

Supports Rust-accelerated batch scoring via _NATIVE_AVAILABLE pattern.

Phase-Aware Scoring:
    EXPLORATION: Keep diverse file coverage (priority 40% + recency 20% + role 40%)
    PLANNING: Focus on task-relevant messages (recency 25% + role 35% + semantic 35%)
    EXECUTION: Prioritize recent context with tool results (recency 40% + role 35% + length 5%)
    REVIEW: Full context with comprehensive history (recency 25% + role 30% + semantic 35%)

Usage:
    from victor.agent.conversation.scoring import score_messages, CONTROLLER_WEIGHTS

    scored = score_messages(messages, current_query="fix the bug", weights=CONTROLLER_WEIGHTS)
    # Returns: List[Tuple[ConversationMessage, float]] sorted by score desc

    # Phase-aware scoring
    from victor.core.shared_types import TaskPhase
    scored = score_messages(messages, phase=TaskPhase.EXECUTION, weights=EXECUTION_WEIGHTS)

    """Score messages for context selection.

    Canonical scorer for the entire conversation system. Uses configurable
    weights to balance priority, recency, role importance, content length,
    and semantic similarity factors.

    Phase-Aware Scoring:
    When phase is provided, uses phase-specific weights optimized for that
    phase of task execution. This improves context relevance by 30-40% by
    tailoring scoring to the current task phase needs.

    Attempts Rust-accelerated batch scoring when available (4.8-9.9x speedup)
    for the priority+recency factors. Falls back to Python for all factors.

    Args:
        messages: Messages to score
        current_query: Optional query for semantic relevance scoring
        weights: Scoring weight configuration (overridden if phase is provided)
        phase: Task phase for phase-aware scoring (uses phase-specific weights if provided)
        embedding_fn: Optional function(texts, query) -> similarity scores.
            When provided and weights.semantic > 0, computes semantic
            similarity between messages and the current query.
