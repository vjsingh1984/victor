"""Conversation state machine for intelligent stage detection.

MIGRATION NOTICE: State storage is migrating to canonical system.

For state storage, use the canonical state management system:
    - victor.state.ConversationStateManager - Conversation scope state
    - victor.state.get_global_manager() - Unified access to all scopes

This module is kept for its stage detection business logic.
The ConversationStateMachine now uses ConversationStateManager internally
for state storage.

---

Legacy Documentation:

This module provides automatic detection of conversation stages to improve
tool selection accuracy. Instead of manual stage management, it infers the
current stage from:
- Tool execution history
- Message content patterns
- Observed file/resource access
- Conversation depth

Stages:
- INITIAL: First interaction, exploring the request
- PLANNING: Understanding scope, searching for files
- READING: Examining files, gathering context
- ANALYSIS: Reviewing code, analyzing structure
- EXECUTION: Making changes, running commands
- VERIFICATION: Testing, validating changes
- COMPLETION: Summarizing, wrapping up

Hook Integration (Observer Pattern):
The state machine supports hooks for observing transitions:
- on_enter: Called when entering a stage
- on_exit: Called when exiting a stage
- on_transition: Called on any stage change

Example:
    from victor.observability import StateHookManager

    hooks = StateHookManager()

    @hooks.on_transition
    def log_transition(old, new, ctx):
        print(f"{old} -> {new}")

    machine = ConversationStateMachine(hooks=hooks)

Migration Example:
    # OLD (using ConversationStateMachine for state storage):
    machine = ConversationStateMachine()
    machine.record_tool_execution("read", {"file": "test.py"})
    stage = machine.get_stage()

    # NEW (using canonical state management):
    from victor.state import ConversationStateManager, StateScope

    # For stage detection, still use ConversationStateMachine:
    machine = ConversationStateMachine()
    machine.record_tool_execution("read", {"file": "test.py"})
    stage = machine.get_stage()

    # For state storage, use ConversationStateManager:
    mgr = ConversationStateManager()
    await mgr.set("tool_history", ["read"])
    await mgr.set("observed_files", {"test.py"})

    # OR for unified access:
    from victor.state import get_global_manager
    state = get_global_manager()
    await state.set("tool_history", ["read"], scope=StateScope.CONVERSATION)
