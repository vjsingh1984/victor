"""Shared tool registry for memory-efficient concurrent sessions.

This module provides a singleton registry that shares tool class definitions
across multiple AgentOrchestrator instances. This significantly reduces memory
footprint when running concurrent sessions, as tool classes are discovered
and stored only once.

Design Pattern: Singleton + Flyweight
====================================
- Singleton: Ensures only one SharedToolRegistry instance exists
- Flyweight: Tool classes are shared objects, while per-session state is kept separate

Memory Savings:
- Without sharing: 100 sessions x 61 tools x ~150KB = ~900MB
- With sharing: 1 registry + 100 sessions x per-session state = ~20MB

Usage:
    from victor.agent.shared_tool_registry import SharedToolRegistry

    # Get the singleton instance
    registry = SharedToolRegistry.get_instance()

    # Get all tool classes (cached after first call)
    tool_classes = registry.get_tool_classes()

    # Create a new tool instance (for per-session use if needed)
    tool_instance = registry.create_tool_instance("read_file")

    # For test isolation
    SharedToolRegistry.reset_instance()
