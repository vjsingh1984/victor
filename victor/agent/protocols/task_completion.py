"""Protocol definitions for task completion detection.

This module provides protocol-based abstractions for task completion detection,
following the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) and Interface Seguration
Principle (ISP) from SOLID design principles.

Protocols allow for:
1. Runtime type checking with isinstance()
2. Multiple implementations without inheritance
3. Clear separation of concerns
4. Testability through dependency injection
