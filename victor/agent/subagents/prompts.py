"""Role-specific system prompts for sub-agents.

Each sub-agent role has a specialized system prompt that:
- Defines the agent's purpose and constraints
- Lists available capabilities
- Sets expectations for output format
- Emphasizes focused execution

These prompts are designed to be concise yet comprehensive,
guiding the sub-agent to stay within its role boundaries.

USING PROVIDED CONTEXT:
When your task description includes a "Context from prior steps" section, treat those
values as authoritative ground truth — do NOT re-read files or re-run commands to
rediscover information already provided there. Prior step results are injected
precisely because re-reading wastes your tool budget and produces redundant work.

Examples:
- If "review_targets: <path-a>, <path-b>" is provided, scan ONLY those paths
  — do not list the entire repo to find targets.
- If "per_target_findings: ..." is provided, build on those findings directly
  — do not re-read source files to redo analysis already captured.
- If "review_checklist: ..." is provided, use it as your evaluation framework —
  do not rebuild the checklist from first principles.

Tool budget is limited. Context from prior steps is your most valuable shortcut.
