"""Agent teams for coordinated multi-agent execution.

This module provides infrastructure for creating and coordinating teams of
specialized agents working toward shared goals. Similar to CrewAI's Crew
concept but built on Victor's existing SubAgent infrastructure.

Key Concepts:
- TeamFormation: How agents are organized (sequential, parallel, hierarchical, pipeline)
- TeamMember: Individual agent in a team with role and goal
- TeamCoordinator: Orchestrates team execution
- TeamMessageBus: Inter-agent communication

Example Usage:
    from victor.agent.teams import (
        TeamConfig,
        TeamMember,
        TeamFormation,
        TeamCoordinator,
    )
    from victor.agent.subagents import SubAgentRole

    # Define team members
    members = [
        TeamMember(
            id="researcher",
            role=SubAgentRole.RESEARCHER,
            name="Code Researcher",
            goal="Find all authentication-related code",
        ),
        TeamMember(
            id="planner",
            role=SubAgentRole.PLANNER,
            name="Implementation Planner",
            goal="Create implementation plan based on research",
        ),
        TeamMember(
            id="executor",
            role=SubAgentRole.EXECUTOR,
            name="Code Implementer",
            goal="Implement the planned changes",
        ),
    ]

    # Create team configuration
    config = TeamConfig(
        name="Auth Refactoring Team",
        goal="Refactor authentication to use JWT",
        members=members,
        formation=TeamFormation.PIPELINE,
    )

    # Execute team
    coordinator = TeamCoordinator(orchestrator)
    result = await coordinator.execute_team(config)

    print(f"Success: {result.success}")
    print(f"Total tool calls: {result.total_tool_calls}")
