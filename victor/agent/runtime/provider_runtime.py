"""Provider runtime boundaries for AgentOrchestrator.

This module extracts provider runtime wiring from orchestrator construction.

Migration Notes (2026-05-01):
- ProviderCoordinator removed from ProviderRuntimeComponents (unused internally)
- ProviderSwitchCoordinator removed from ProviderRuntimeComponents (unused internally)
- ProviderService is the canonical owner for provider operations
- Removed coordinator root shims stay absent in v1.0.0+
