"""Async-first tool execution module.

This module provides async-first tool execution with:
- Automatic parallelization for read-only operations
- Dependency graph execution
- File locking for concurrent writes
- Priority-based scheduling

Design Patterns:
- Strategy Pattern: Pluggable execution strategies
- Repository Pattern: File lock management
- Command Pattern: Tool execution commands
