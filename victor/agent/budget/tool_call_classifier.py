"""Tool call classification.

This module provides ToolCallClassifier, which handles tool operation
classification. Extracted from BudgetManager to follow the Single
Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Open/Closed Principle (OCP).

Part of SOLID-based refactoring to eliminate god class anti-pattern.
