"""Console error display for tool execution results.

Extracted from the ``tool_service`` hotspot (size-ratcheted module). Owns the
"show a tool error on the console, once" concern:

- "not found" errors are deduplicated per tool for the session
- while an interactive live renderer owns console output, nothing is printed
  here at all — the renderer surfaces the failure as its own ✗ error card,
  so a service-level print would be a duplicate
