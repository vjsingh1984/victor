"""Shared temperature-resolution seam for the buffered and streaming paths (ADR-013).

Both ``TurnExecutor`` (buffered) and the streaming pipeline call :func:`resolve_effective_temperature`
so a given ``(task_type, model, base, context)`` resolves identically regardless of mode — this is what
closes the buffered/streaming divergence. The helper is orchestrator-duck-typed (reads
``temperature_resolver`` / ``profile_task_temperatures`` / ``settings_task_temperatures``) and degrades
to ``base_temperature`` when no resolver is available.
