Emits a ``PROMPT_CANDIDATE_USED`` RL event for each prompt candidate served
during a turn, carrying the turn's completion score so the ``prompt_optimizer``
learner can update the candidate's Thompson posterior. Extracted into its own
module to avoid growing the ``runtime_intelligence`` hotspot.

# rather than prompt quality (every non-terminal turn would otherwise penalize
# the served candidate). See FEP-0017.
