    """[CANONICAL] Protocol for chat operations service.

    This protocol represents the target architecture for chat operations,
    replacing the facade-driven Coordinator pattern with a state-passed
    Service pattern.

    This protocol follows the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    by focusing only on chat-related operations.

    Methods:
        chat: Process a chat message with optional streaming
        stream_chat: Stream chat response in chunks
        reset_conversation: Reset conversation history

    Example:
        class MyChatService(ChatServiceProtocol):
            def __init__(self, provider, tool_service, context_service):
                self._provider = provider
                self._tools = tool_service
                self._context = context_service

            async def chat(self, user_message: str, **kwargs) -> CompletionResponse:
                # Process message with agentic loop
                pass

            async def stream_chat(self, user_message: str, **kwargs) -> AsyncIterator[StreamChunk]:
