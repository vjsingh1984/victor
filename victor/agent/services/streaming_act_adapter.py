"""Streaming ACT adapter — bridges the unified loop to the service-layer streaming primitive.

FEP-0007 Addendum A (framing B): ``AgenticLoop.run_streaming`` drives a narrow framework seam
(``StreamingActProvider.stream_turn_act``) for its ACT, decoupled from streaming plumbing. This
adapter implements that seam over the service-layer
``StreamingChatExecutor.execute_turn_streaming`` (the per-turn provider + emit + tools primitive).

One adapter instance per ``run_streaming`` call: :meth:`StreamingActAdapter.prepare` runs the
per-run setup once (stream context, task intent/goals, recovery handles), and
:meth:`StreamingActAdapter.stream_turn_act` drives one turn's ACT — re-yielding its
``StreamChunk``s and mapping the produced ``TurnResult`` onto the framework outcome holder.

This module is the connective tissue for the step-3 cutover; it is not yet wired into
``ChatStreamRuntime`` (the repoint that makes ``run_streaming`` the live UI loop). Two per-run
concerns are deliberately deferred to that cutover, where they are exercised live and parity-gated:

* the governance REQUEST gate (a block must short-circuit the whole run, not one turn), and
* reconciling the buffered loop's eager completion so the unified loop runs full multi-step tasks
  (see the run/stream parity battery's cutover tripwire).
