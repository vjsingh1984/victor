"""Service adapters for protocol compatibility.

This package provides adapters that bridge existing components to service
protocols. Unlike deprecated coordinator shims, these adapters wrap
canonical implementations without fallback paths.

Deprecated adapter shims (ToolServiceAdapter, SessionServiceAdapter) were
removed in the service-first architecture migration. Use the canonical
services directly:
- ToolService for tool operations
- SessionService for session lifecycle
- ContextServiceAdapter for conversation context
