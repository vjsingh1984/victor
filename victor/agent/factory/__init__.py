"""Factory package for creating AgentOrchestrator components.

This package decomposes the monolithic OrchestratorFactory into focused
builder modules grouped by domain:

- **tool_builders**: Tool registry, executor, pipeline, selector, cache, etc.
- **runtime_builders**: Streaming, conversation, provider, lifecycle, etc.
- **infrastructure_builders**: Observability, tracing, metrics, analytics, etc.
- **coordination_builders**: Recovery, workflow, team, safety, middleware, etc.

The OrchestratorFactory class is a thin facade that inherits from all builder
mixins and adds the DI container property and unified create_agent method.

Part of CRITICAL-001: Monolithic Orchestrator decomposition.

Usage:
    from victor.agent.factory import OrchestratorFactory, OrchestratorComponents

    factory = OrchestratorFactory(settings, provider, model)
    components = factory.create_all_components()
