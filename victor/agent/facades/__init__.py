"""Domain facade for orchestrator decomposition.

``OrchestrationFacade`` is the one live runtime-facing migration boundary,
exposing already-initialized components behind a coherent domain boundary
(service-first surfaces ``chat_service``/``tool_service``/``session_service`` and
state-passed surfaces ``exploration_state_passed``/``system_prompt_state_passed``/
``safety_state_passed``). It is read by ``framework/agent.py`` and the turn
execution runtime via ``orchestrator._orchestration_facade``.

The seven per-domain facades (Chat/Tool/Session/Provider/Resilience/Workflow/
Metrics) were removed: they were constructed lazily in the bootstrapper but had
zero production readers (the orchestrator never delegated through them), so they
were dead parallel views. The orchestrator owns its component properties directly.
