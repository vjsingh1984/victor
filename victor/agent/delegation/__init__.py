"""Task delegation infrastructure for agent-to-agent work handoff.

This module provides the delegation protocol that allows agents to spawn
specialized sub-agents for specific tasks. This enables:

- Dynamic task decomposition at runtime
- Specialized agents for specific sub-tasks
- Hierarchical agent structures
- Fire-and-forget or await-result patterns

Key Components:
- DelegationRequest: Request for task delegation
- DelegationResponse: Response from delegation
- DelegationHandler: Processes delegation requests
- DelegateTool: Tool interface for agents to delegate

Example Usage:
    # Agent uses the delegate tool
    result = await delegate_tool.execute(
        task="Find all authentication endpoints in the codebase",
        role="researcher",
        tool_budget=15,
        await_result=True,
    )

    if result.success:
        print(result.result)  # Findings from the researcher

The delegation system integrates with Victor's tool system, appearing as
a regular tool that agents can call during execution.
