"""FEP-0012 Phase 6: the decision → outcome reward junction.

``log_decision`` (``chain.py``) records every decision with a correlation
spine (``session_id``/``turn_id``/``decision_id``) to the JSONL log. This
module stamps the **outcome** side: once a session/task resolves (pass/fail),
:func:`record_session_outcome` writes one ``decision_outcome`` row per
decision logged under that session, carrying the reward.

The junction is what lets the trainer do **reward-supervised** (not
imitation) learning — :mod:`victor.ml.outcome_training` JOINs the JSONL
decisions to these outcome rows by ``decision_id``.

Design notes
------------
- Decisions live in the JSONL log (``log_decision``'s fast-append path); the
  SQL ``decision_log`` table is not yet written. This reader reads the JSONL
  directly (same source as ``victor.evaluation.manifest``) and writes outcomes
  to the durable SQL ``decision_outcome`` table — so outcomes accumulate and
  survive JSONL rotation even though the full decision text stays in JSONL.
- v1 credit is **uniform** (``credit_method="session_uniform"``): every
  decision in the session gets ``attributed_reward``. The schema reserves
  ``credit_method``/``segment_rewards`` for GAE/recency-weighted credit later.
- Recording is **idempotent**: it DELETEs existing rows for the session first,
  so re-recording (or a resumed run) replaces rather than duplicates.
- Best-effort: like ``log_decision``, it never raises — a DB problem must not
  break the benchmark/session.
