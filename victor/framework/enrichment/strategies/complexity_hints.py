"""Complexity-based prompt hints for the enrichment pipeline.

This module provides prompt hints based on task complexity. These hints
are injected into prompts via the enrichment pipeline, following SRP
by keeping prompt engineering separate from classification.

Design Principles:
- SRP: Only handles prompt hint generation
- Classification is done by framework/task/complexity.py
- Hints flow through the enrichment pipeline, not hardcoded in classifier

Usage:
    from victor.framework.task import TaskComplexity
    from victor.framework.enrichment.strategies import ComplexityHintEnricher

    enricher = ComplexityHintEnricher()
    hint = enricher.get_hint(TaskComplexity.COMPLEX)
    # -> "[COMPLEX] Deep work needed. Examine code systematically..."
"""
