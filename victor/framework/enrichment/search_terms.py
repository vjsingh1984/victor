"""Search term extraction utilities.

Provides domain-agnostic search term extraction from prompts for
web search enrichment. Supports native Rust acceleration with Python fallback.

Performance:
    Uses native Rust pattern matching when available for 10-100x faster
    extraction. Falls back to Python re module.

Example:
    from victor.framework.enrichment.search_terms import extract_search_terms

    terms = extract_search_terms("What is machine learning and how does it work?")
    # ['machine learning', 'work']
