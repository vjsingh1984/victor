"""Protocol interfaces for workflow coordinators.

Defines the contracts that coordinators must implement, following the
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) by depending on abstractions.

These protocols enable:
- Protocol-based dependency injection
- Easy testing with mock implementations
- Clear separation of concerns
- Type-safe coordinator composition
