"""Workflow coordinators for SRP-compliant WorkflowEngine.

This package splits the WorkflowEngine responsibilities into focused
coordinators, each handling a single domain:

- YAMLWorkflowCoordinator: YAML workflow loading and execution
- GraphExecutionCoordinator: StateGraph/CompiledGraph execution
- HITLCoordinator: Human-in-the-Loop integration
- CacheCoordinator: Workflow caching management

Architecture:
    WorkflowEngine (Facade)
    ├── YAMLWorkflowCoordinator     # execute_yaml(), stream_yaml()
    ├── GraphExecutionCoordinator   # execute_graph(), stream_graph()
    ├── HITLCoordinator             # execute_with_hitl()
    └── CacheCoordinator            # enable_caching(), clear_cache()

This follows the Single Responsibility Principle by ensuring each
coordinator has one reason to change.
