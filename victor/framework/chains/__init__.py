"""Framework-level chain registry for versioned tool chains.

This package provides a central registry for LCEL-composed tool chains
that can be shared across all verticals.

Example:
    from victor.framework.chains import ChainRegistry

    # Register a chain
    ChainRegistry.register_chain(
        name="safe_edit_chain",
        version="0.5.0",
        chain=safe_edit_chain,
        category="editing",
        description="Safe edit with verification"
    )

    # Retrieve a chain
    chain = ChainRegistry.get_chain("safe_edit_chain")
"""

from .registry import ChainMetadata, ChainRegistry, get_chain_registry

__all__ = [
    "ChainMetadata",
    "ChainRegistry",
    "get_chain_registry",
