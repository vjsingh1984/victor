"""Observability framework for Victor.

This package provides unified observability for all components in the
Victor framework, including metrics collection, aggregation, and
dashboard integration.

Phase 4: Enhance Observability with Unified Dashboard

Main Components:
- ObservabilityManager: Central manager for metrics collection
- Metric data models: CounterMetric, GaugeMetric, HistogramMetric, SummaryMetric
- MetricsSnapshot: Point-in-time metrics from a source
- DashboardData: Aggregated data for dashboard display

Example:
    from victor.framework.observability import (
        ObservabilityManager,
        CounterMetric,
        GaugeMetric,
        MetricNames,
    )

    # Get the manager instance
    manager = ObservabilityManager.get_instance()

    # Register your component as a metrics source
    manager.register_source(my_component)

    # Collect metrics
    collection = manager.collect_metrics()

    # Get dashboard data
    dashboard = manager.get_dashboard_data()
    print(f"Cache hit rate: {dashboard['cache_metrics']['hit_rate']:.2%}")
