"""Canonical default reward derivation for RL outcomes (R2).

Single home for "reward from an outcome's success + quality". Before this module,
reward-from-outcome was derived in several places — including an ad-hoc inline
``quality_score or (1.0 if success else 0.3)`` in the tool-selection runtime — each
a separate, drifting source of truth.

Learners MAY still override ``_compute_reward`` for domain-specific *shaping*
(e.g. ``tool_selector`` weights success/completion/grounding/efficiency). That is
legitimate and untouched. What this module removes is the *unmanaged default*: any
site that just needs "reward from success + quality" should call these helpers
rather than reinventing the formula. See ``docs/architecture/observability-axes.md``
(the reward-derivation rule). Note: ``ImplicitFeedback.compute_reward`` is a
distinct, richer multi-signal reducer (task_completed/tool_success/grounding/…)
operating on accumulated session state, not a single outcome — it is intentionally
separate from this default.
