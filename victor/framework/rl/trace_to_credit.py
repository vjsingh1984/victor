"""Derive segment-level process reward from a trace and feed it to the learners (Vision P6).

The credit-assignment framework (``victor/framework/rl/credit_assignment.py``, 9 methods) was fully
built but **unused** — the learners consumed only outcome-level reward. This module closes that loop:
it turns an ``AgenticExecutionTrace`` into per-action process rewards, densifies them via the existing
``CreditAssignmentIntegration``, and blends the mean process reward into the outcome's quality score
so every learner benefits without touching any individual learner (the blend happens once, at
outcome construction). Fully backward-compatible: no trace / no tool activity ⇒ quality unchanged.
