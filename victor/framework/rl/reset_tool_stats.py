"""Reset RL statistics for specific tools to give them a fresh start.

Use this when significant improvements have been made to a tool's reliability
or performance, and you want the RL system to relearn from scratch rather than
being biased by historical poor performance.

Example:
    # After fixing graph tool performance issues
    reset_tool_stats("graph")
    reset_tool_stats("code_search")
