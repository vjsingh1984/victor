"""MIPROv2-inspired few-shot prompt adaptation.

This is not a full implementation of the original MIPROv2 optimizer with
proposal search and Bayesian optimization. In the current framework shape,
it serves as a query-aware few-shot retriever that mines successful traces,
prefers stronger examples, enforces light diversity, and bounds the injected
few-shot payload size.
