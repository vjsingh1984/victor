"""Prompt history pruning to prevent unbounded database growth.

The agent_prompt_history table accumulates every prompt used during sessions.
This module provides automatic cleanup to keep only recent, high-value entries.

Usage:
    from victor.framework.rl.learners.prompt_history_pruner import prune_prompt_history

    # Keep last 1000 entries per provider
    prune_prompt_history(max_entries_per_provider=1000)

    # Keep entries from last 7 days
    prune_prompt_history(max_age_days=7)
