"""Correlation tracking for dependence-aware pooling.

This module provides correlation tracking between agent predictions
to enable dependence-aware Bayesian consensus formation.

When agents' predictions are correlated, their messages don't provide
independent evidence. This tracker detects and adjusts for such
correlations to avoid overcounting evidence.

Based on: "Position: agentic AI orchestration should be Bayes-consistent"
(arXiv:2605.00742, ICML 2026)
