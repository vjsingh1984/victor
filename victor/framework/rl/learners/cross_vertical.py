"""Cross-vertical transfer learning for sharing patterns across verticals.

This learner identifies common patterns (e.g., "edit tasks benefit from BUILD mode")
and applies them across verticals. It enables knowledge transfer between coding,
devops, data_analysis, and research verticals.

Strategy:
- Analyze RL outcomes across all verticals
- Identify patterns with consistent behavior (high confidence)
- Generate recommendations applicable to new/underrepresented verticals
- Reduce cold-start problem for new verticals

Architecture:
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                 CrossVerticalLearner                             │
    ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │  1. Pattern Discovery: Find consistent patterns across verticals│
    │  2. Confidence Scoring: Score patterns by cross-vertical support│
    │  3. Recommendation: Apply patterns to new verticals             │
    │  4. Observation: Track pattern application success              │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Usage:
    from victor.framework.rl.learners.cross_vertical import CrossVerticalLearner

    learner = CrossVerticalLearner("cross_vertical", db_connection)

    # Get patterns applicable to a specific vertical
    patterns = learner.get_shared_patterns(target_vertical="devops")

    # Apply patterns in a cold-start scenario
    recommendation = learner.get_recommendation(
        task_type="edit",
        target_vertical="research",
