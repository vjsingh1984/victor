"""Agentic Graph - StateGraph-based agentic loop implementation.

This module provides a StateGraph-based implementation of the agentic loop,
replacing the custom while loop with a declarative graph-based approach.

Architecture:
    StateGraph (PERCEIVE -> PLAN -> ACT -> EVALUATE -> DECIDE)
        ├── perceive_node: Intent understanding via PerceptionIntegration
        ├── plan_node: Execution planning via PlanningCoordinator
        ├── act_node: Tool execution via TurnExecutor
        ├── evaluate_node: Progress evaluation via FulfillmentDetector
        └── decide: Conditional edge routing back to PERCEIVE or END

Components:
    - state: AgenticLoopStateModel and helpers
    - nodes: Core agentic loop nodes (perceive, plan, act, evaluate)
    - builder: Graph construction utilities
    - executor: AgenticLoopGraphExecutor for running the graph
    - coordinator_nodes: State-passed coordinator adapters
    - service_nodes: Service provider nodes (chat, tool, context, provider)
    - team_selector: Formation selection logic

Example:
    from victor.framework.agentic_graph import (
        AgenticLoopStateModel,
        create_agentic_loop_graph,
        AgenticLoopGraphExecutor,
    )

    # Canonical typed-state usage
    graph = create_agentic_loop_graph(max_iterations=10)
    compiled = graph.compile()
    state = AgenticLoopStateModel(query="Fix the authentication bug", max_iterations=10)
    result = await compiled.invoke(state)

    # Runtime executor usage
    executor = AgenticLoopGraphExecutor(execution_context, max_iterations=10)
    result = await executor.run("Fix the authentication bug")

Compatibility note:
    ``AgenticLoopStateModel`` is the canonical state type. Passing a raw ``dict``
    to ``compiled.invoke()`` is supported only as a compatibility path. Builder-
    owned defaults such as ``max_iterations`` are injected automatically, but
    callers should prefer the typed model for explicitness and validation.

Team Architecture Note:
    Teams are formations, not separate graphs. Use UnifiedTeamCoordinator
    directly as a StateGraph node:

        from victor.teams import UnifiedTeamCoordinator, TeamFormation
        coordinator = UnifiedTeamCoordinator(orchestrator)
        coordinator.set_formation(TeamFormation.PARALLEL)
        graph.add_node("team", coordinator)  # Direct usage!
