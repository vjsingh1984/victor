"""Team formation selector for StateGraph integration (Phase 4 consolidation).

This module provides logic to select the appropriate team formation
based on task characteristics, complexity, and team size.

Key Components:
- FormationCriteria: Dataclass for formation selection inputs
- select_formation: Main selection function
- DEFAULT_FORMATION: Fallback formation when no criteria match

Selection Rules:
1. Single agent (team_size <= 1) → SEQUENTIAL
2. Consensus required → CONSENSUS
3. Large teams (team_size >= 5) → HIERARCHICAL
4. Workflow task with dependencies → PIPELINE
5. Independent tasks → PARALLEL
6. Dependent tasks → SEQUENTIAL
7. High complexity → HIERARCHICAL
8. Task-specific overrides (debugging → SEQUENTIAL, research → PARALLEL)
