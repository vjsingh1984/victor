"""Multi-agent system components for persona-based team collaboration.

This package provides generic building blocks for constructing multi-agent
systems with configurable personas and team structures.

Example:
    from victor.framework.multi_agent import (
        PersonaTraits,
        CommunicationStyle,
        ExpertiseLevel,
        TeamTemplate,
        TeamTopology,
        TeamSpec,
        TeamMember,
    )

    # Create a persona with traits
    researcher = PersonaTraits(
        name="Research Analyst",
        role="researcher",
        description="Analyzes codebases and finds patterns",
        communication_style=CommunicationStyle.TECHNICAL,
        expertise_level=ExpertiseLevel.EXPERT,
        strengths=["pattern recognition", "thorough analysis"],
        preferred_tools=["grep_codebase", "read_file"],
    )

    # Create a team template
    template = TeamTemplate(
        name="Code Review Team",
        description="Reviews code for quality and security",
        topology=TeamTopology.PIPELINE,
        member_slots={"researcher": 1, "reviewer": 2},
    )

    # Build a concrete team
    team = TeamSpec(
        template=template,
        members=[
            TeamMember(persona=researcher, role_in_team="lead_researcher", is_leader=True),
        ],
    )
