"""Emergent Collaboration Patterns Framework.

This module provides data-driven pattern discovery and recommendation
for workflow collaboration patterns.

Key Components:
    - PatternMiner: Discovers patterns from execution traces
    - PatternRecommender: Suggests optimal patterns for tasks
    - PatternValidator: Validates pattern quality and safety
    - CollaborationPattern: Pattern representation

Example:
    from victor.framework.patterns import (
        PatternMiner,
        PatternRecommender,
        TaskContext,
        CollaborationPattern,
    )

    # Mine patterns from execution history
    miner = PatternMiner(min_occurrences=3)
    patterns = await miner.mine_from_traces(execution_traces)

    # Get recommendations for new task
    recommender = PatternRecommender(patterns)
    context = TaskContext(
        task_description="Implement authentication",
        required_capabilities=["coding", "security"],
        complexity="high",
    )
    recommendations = await recommender.recommend(context, top_k=3)
