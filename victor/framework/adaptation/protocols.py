"""Focused protocols for dynamic workflow adaptation.

This module defines ISP-compliant protocols for runtime workflow graph
modification. Each protocol has a single, well-defined responsibility.

Protocol Separation:
- GraphValidator: Validation only - no modification logic
- GraphApplier: Application only - assumes already validated
- GraphRollback: Rollback only - separate concern
- ImpactAnalyzer: Impact analysis - separate concern

Following the refinement plan, these protocols extend existing Victor
infrastructure and follow SOLID principles.
