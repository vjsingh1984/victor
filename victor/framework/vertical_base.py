"""Compatibility shim for core vertical runtime types.

This module remains as a stable framework-facing surface for in-repo code and
incremental migrations, but new external vertical packages should prefer
``victor_sdk`` definition-layer contracts directly. In particular, external
authors should import ``VerticalBase`` from ``victor_sdk`` and publish
``victor.plugins`` entry points via a ``VictorPlugin`` wrapper.

Usage::

    # Compatibility shim for framework-side code
    from victor.framework.vertical_base import (
        VerticalBase,
        VerticalConfig,
        StageDefinition,
        StageBuilder,
        register_vertical,
        ExtensionDependency,
    )

    # Preferred contract for external vertical packages
    from victor_sdk import ExtensionDependency, VerticalBase, register_vertical
"""

from victor.core.verticals.base import VerticalBase, VerticalConfig
from victor.core.vertical_types import StageDefinition, StageBuilder
from victor_sdk import ExtensionDependency, register_vertical

__all__ = [
    "VerticalBase",
    "VerticalConfig",
    "StageDefinition",
    "StageBuilder",
    "register_vertical",
    "ExtensionDependency",
]
