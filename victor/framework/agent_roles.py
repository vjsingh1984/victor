"""Built-in agent roles for multi-agent team coordination.

This module provides pre-defined roles for common team configurations.
Each role defines capabilities, allowed tools, and system prompt sections.

Roles:
- ManagerRole: Coordinates team, delegates tasks, approves work
- ResearcherRole: Analyzes codebase, searches for information
- ExecutorRole: Implements changes, writes code, executes commands
- ReviewerRole: Reviews work, provides feedback, approves changes

Example:
    from victor.framework.agent_roles import get_role, ManagerRole

    # Get a role by name
    researcher = get_role("researcher")

    # Or instantiate directly
    manager = ManagerRole()

    # Use in team coordination
    if AgentCapability.DELEGATE in manager.capabilities:
        # Manager can delegate tasks
        pass

You should NOT directly write code or make changes. Instead, delegate
implementation tasks to executor agents and research tasks to researcher agents.
