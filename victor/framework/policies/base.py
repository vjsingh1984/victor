"""Base class for governance policies.

A policy is a small, single-responsibility unit (cost budget, tool gate, …).
The shape deliberately mirrors the lightweight middleware classes in
``victor/framework/middleware.py`` (e.g. ``GitSafetyMiddleware``): declare the
phases and tools you care about, then implement :meth:`evaluate`.
