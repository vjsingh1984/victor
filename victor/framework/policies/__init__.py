"""Governance policy engine for Victor.

A declarative ALLOW / DENY / ASK governance layer over agent tool execution
and message phases, assembled from existing framework primitives (the
middleware chain, the turn boundary, HITL approvals, and token/cost
accounting). See ``feps/fep-0005-policy-engine.md``.

Typical wiring (done by the agent factory when the feature is enabled)::

    from victor.framework.policies import (
        PolicyEngine, PolicyEngineMiddleware, CostBudgetPolicy, MaxToolCallsPolicy,
    )

    engine = PolicyEngine([
        CostBudgetPolicy(max_cost_usd=5.0, ask_thresholds_usd=[3.0]),
        MaxToolCallsPolicy(limit=50),
    ])
    middleware = PolicyEngineMiddleware(engine, context_provider=provide_ctx)
    chain.add(middleware)
