"""Core data types for the governance policy engine.

A :class:`Policy` evaluates a :class:`PolicyEvent` (a phase + the tool/result
under inspection plus a :class:`PolicyContext` snapshot) and returns a
:class:`PolicyVerdict` (ALLOW / DENY / ASK). The :class:`~victor.framework.
policies.engine.PolicyEngine` composes an ordered list of policies into a
single verdict.

These types are intentionally framework-internal and dependency-free so the
engine can be unit-tested without booting services.
