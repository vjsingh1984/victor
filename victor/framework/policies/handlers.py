"""Approval handlers for resolving policy ASK verdicts.

An approval handler is the standard HITL ``ApprovalHandler`` callable
(``victor.framework.hitl``): ``async (ApprovalRequest) -> (status, response,
responder)``. The :class:`~victor.framework.policies.middleware.
PolicyEngineMiddleware` uses one to turn an ASK verdict into an approve/reject
decision.

This module provides an interactive console handler for CLI sessions. Library
and server callers should supply their own handler (e.g. one that elicits over
a websocket) rather than the console one.
