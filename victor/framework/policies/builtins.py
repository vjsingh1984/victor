"""Built-in governance policies.

Three policies cover the most common governance needs and mirror Omnigent's
builtins:

* :class:`CostBudgetPolicy` — cap session spend, ask at soft thresholds.
* :class:`AskOnToolsPolicy` — require approval before high-impact tools.
* :class:`MaxToolCallsPolicy` — cap tool calls per session (loop/cost guard).

    user can switch to a cheaper model (via ``/model``) to keep working — the
    gate only blocks expensive spend. Soft ``ask_thresholds_usd`` each trigger a
    one-time ASK as cost crosses them.

    If cost is unavailable (``context.cost_usd == 0.0`` because pricing isn't
    configured), the gate simply never trips (fail-open) — matching Omnigent's
    "no pricing -> gate never trips" behaviour.
