"""Shared graph algorithm utilities.

Provides reusable graph traversal algorithms used by both StateGraph
(victor.framework.graph) and DependencyGraph (victor.core.verticals.dependency_graph).

This module eliminates duplication of reachability analysis, cycle detection,
and topological sorting across the codebase.

Design Principles:
    - Pure functions (no side effects, no mutations)
    - Work with adjacency-list representations (Dict[str, Set[str]])
    - Protocol-agnostic: usable by any graph-like structure
