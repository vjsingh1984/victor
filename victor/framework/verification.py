"""Framework-level verification protocol (FEP-0018).

Defines the ``Verifier`` protocol — a pluggable component that verifies the
agent's work after it claims done and provides structured feedback for retry.
Any agent session (interactive chat, benchmark eval, workflow, CLI) can use it.

Zero victor-package dependencies (stdlib only) so any module can import it
without circular-import risk.

Usage:
    class MyVerifier:
        async def verify(self, *, workspace=None, state=None) -> VerificationResult:
            ...

    loop = AgenticLoop(..., verifier=MyVerifier(), max_verify_retries=2)
