"""UI-ephemeral progress channel for long-running tools.

Long-running tools (shell, code_search, graph) can stream partial stdout/stderr
to an active live renderer *while they run* so the user sees output progressively
instead of a final blob. This output is purely for human visibility — it is
**never** added to the conversation, persisted, or sent to the model, so it is
decoupled from the LLM message stream and from ``OutputPruner`` entirely.

Design:
- A single process-global sink, intended for the single-active-turn interactive
  CLI. The rendering layer registers a sink around a turn; tools emit through it.
- When no sink is registered (the default — API/server path, tests, headless),
  ``emit_tool_progress`` is a cheap no-op, so this has zero behavioural effect.
- Emission is best-effort: a failing sink never propagates into tool execution.
