"""State merging strategies for hybrid orchestration.

This module provides strategies for merging state from multi-agent teams
back into workflow graphs. It handles conflicts when both the team and
graph modify the same keys.

Design Principles (SOLID):
    - Single Responsibility: Each strategy handles one merging approach
    - Open/Closed: Extensible via custom merge functions
    - Liskov Substitution: All strategies implement MergeStrategy protocol
    - Interface Segregation: Small, focused protocols
    - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions (protocols) not concretions

Key Concepts:
    - MergeStrategy: Protocol defining merge behavior
    - StateMergeError: Raised when merge fails validation
    - Merge modes: TEAM_WINS, GRAPH_WINS, MERGE, ERROR

Example:
    from victor.framework.state_merging import (
        dict_merge_strategy,
        list_merge_strategy,
        custom_merge_strategy,
        StateMergeError,
    )

    # Default dict merge (team wins on conflicts)
    merged = dict_merge_strategy(graph_state, team_state)

    # Custom merge with conflict handler
    def resolve_conflicts(key, graph_val, team_val):
        if key == "tool_calls":
            return graph_val + team_val  # Concatenate
        return team_val  # Team wins by default

    merged = custom_merge_strategy(
        graph_state,
        team_state,
        conflict_resolver=resolve_conflicts
    )
