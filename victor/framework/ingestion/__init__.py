"""Framework-level document ingestion utilities.

This module provides domain-agnostic ingestion capabilities that can be
used across all verticals. These are reusable building blocks for
document processing pipelines.

Provides:
- ChunkingConfig: Configuration for document chunking
- ChunkerProtocol: Protocol for vertical-specific chunkers
- BaseChunker: Base implementation with common strategies
- DocumentType detection utilities
- Source handlers for files, URLs, PDFs, HTML

Usage:
    from victor.framework.ingestion import (
        ChunkingConfig,
        BaseChunker,
        detect_document_type,
    )

    config = ChunkingConfig(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100)
    chunker = BaseChunker(config)
    chunks = chunker.chunk_text(content)

Verticals extend this by:
- Providing domain-specific chunking strategies
- Adding metadata extraction relevant to their domain
- Integrating with their storage backends
