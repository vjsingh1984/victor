"""Framework workflow components.

This package provides base classes and utilities for building workflow providers
across verticals. The primary component is BaseYAMLWorkflowProvider, which
eliminates boilerplate in vertical-specific workflow provider implementations.

Key Components:
    - BaseYAMLWorkflowProvider: Template Method pattern base class for YAML
      workflow providers. Subclasses only need to specify the escape hatches
      module path to get full workflow loading, caching, and execution support
      via UnifiedWorkflowCompiler.

Key Features:
    - Two-level caching (definition + execution) for 10x faster repeated runs
    - Checkpointing support for resumable long-running workflows
    - Consistent execution via UnifiedWorkflowCompiler
    - TypedDict/dataclass state support for type safety

Example:
    from victor.framework.workflows import BaseYAMLWorkflowProvider

    class ResearchWorkflowProvider(BaseYAMLWorkflowProvider):
        '''Provides research-specific workflows.'''

        def _get_escape_hatches_module(self) -> str:
            return "victor.research.escape_hatches"

        def get_auto_workflows(self) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
            return [
                (r"deep\\s+research", "deep_research"),
                (r"fact\\s*check", "fact_check"),
            ]

    # Usage (recommended - uses UnifiedWorkflowCompiler with caching)
    provider = ResearchWorkflowProvider()
    result = await provider.run_compiled_workflow("deep_research", {"query": "AI"})

    # Stream with real-time progress
    async for node_id, state in provider.stream_compiled_workflow("deep_research", {}):
        print(f"Completed: {node_id}")
