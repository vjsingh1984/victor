"""Unified team specification schema.

This module provides a single TeamSpec schema that all verticals use,
eliminating the duplication of CodingTeamSpec, ResearchTeamSpec, etc.

Design Goals:
- Single source of truth for team specifications
- Verticals provide data only, not schema definitions
- Support for rich persona attributes (backstory, personality, expertise)
- Tool name canonicalization at schema level

Usage:
    from victor.framework.team_schema import TeamSpec, RoleConfig

    # Define a team spec
    code_review_team = TeamSpec(
        name="Code Review Team",
        description="Reviews code changes for quality",
        vertical="coding",
        formation=TeamFormation.PIPELINE,
        members=[...],
    )

    # Register with the registry
    from victor.framework.team_registry import get_team_registry
    registry = get_team_registry()
    registry.register("coding:code_review", code_review_team)
