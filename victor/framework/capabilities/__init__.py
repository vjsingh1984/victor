"""Generic capability providers for vertical extensions.

This module contains framework-level capability providers that can be reused
across all verticals to promote code reuse and maintain SOLID principles.

Phase 1: Promote Generic Capabilities to Framework

Capabilities:
- BaseCapabilityProvider: Abstract base for vertical capability providers
- CapabilityMetadata: Metadata for capability registration
- FileOperationsCapability: Common file operation tools (read, write, edit, grep)
- PromptContributionCapability: Common prompt hints for task types
- PrivacyCapabilityProvider: Framework-level privacy and PII management (cross-vertical)
- StageBuilderCapability: Generic stage definitions for workflow templates
- GroundingRulesCapability: Centralized grounding rules for vertical constraints
- ValidationCapabilityProvider: Pluggable validation system
- SafetyRulesCapabilityProvider: Reusable safety pattern definitions
- TaskTypeHintCapabilityProvider: Centralized task type hints
- SourceVerificationCapabilityProvider: Source verification for citations
