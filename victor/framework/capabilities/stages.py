"""Stage builder capability for framework-level workflow stages.

This module provides reusable stage definitions with a 7-stage generic workflow
template (INITIAL → COMPLETION) that verticals can use and customize.

Design Pattern: Capability Provider
- Generic stage templates for common workflows
- Stage validation and transition rules
- Stage-to-tool mappings
- Prompt hints per stage

Integration Point:
    Update VerticalBase.get_stages() to use StageBuilderCapability by default

Example:
    capability = StageBuilderCapability()
    stages = capability.get_stages()

    # Customize for specific vertical
    custom_stages = capability.get_custom_stages({
        "PLANNING": {"tools": {"read", "grep"}},
        "EXECUTION": {"tools": {"write", "edit", "shell"}},
    })
