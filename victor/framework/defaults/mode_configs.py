"""Default complexity-to-mode mapping for verticals.

bootstrap mode configuration without hardcoding the base mapping::

    CODING_COMPLEXITY = create_complexity_map(
        complex="thorough",
        highly_complex="architect",

    "simple": "quick",
    "moderate": "standard",
    "complex": "comprehensive",
    "highly_complex": "extended",
}
"""Mapping from complexity level to mode name.

Used by ``RegistryBasedModeConfigProvider.get_mode_for_complexity()``
and available to verticals as a starting point for customisation.
