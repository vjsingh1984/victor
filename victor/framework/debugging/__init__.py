"""Breakpoint and debugging system for StateGraph workflows.

This package provides comprehensive debugging capabilities for Victor's
StateGraph workflows, including breakpoints, execution control, state
inspection, and debug session management.

Key Components:
    BreakpointType: Types of breakpoints (NODE, CONDITIONAL, EXCEPTION, STATE)
    BreakpointPosition: Position relative to node execution (BEFORE, AFTER, ON_ERROR)
    WorkflowBreakpoint: A breakpoint in workflow execution
    BreakpointManager: Manages workflow breakpoints
    ExecutionController: Controls execution pause/resume
    StateInspector: Inspects workflow state
    DebugHook: Integration point with StateGraph
    DebugSession: Debug session facade

Example:
    from victor.framework.debugging import (
        DebugSession,
        DebugSessionConfig,
        BreakpointPosition,
    )

    # Create debug session
    session = DebugSession(
        config=DebugSessionConfig(
            session_id="debug-123",
            workflow_id="code_review"
        ),
        event_bus=event_bus
    )

    # Set breakpoint
    session.set_breakpoint(
        node_id="analyze",
        position=BreakpointPosition.BEFORE
    )

    # Attach to workflow
    result = await workflow.invoke(
        input_state,
        debug_hook=session.create_hook()
    )

    # Control execution
    await session.continue_execution()
