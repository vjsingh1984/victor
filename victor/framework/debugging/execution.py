"""Execution control for workflow debugging.

This module provides pause/resume/step execution control for debugging
StateGraph workflows. Uses asyncio primitives for coordination.

Key Classes:
    ExecutionState: State of debug execution (RUNNING, PAUSED, STEPPING, TERMINATED)
    StepMode: Stepping modes (STEP_OVER, STEP_INTO, STEP_OUT)
    PauseContext: Context when execution is paused
    ExecutionController: Controls execution pause/resume (SRP)

Example:
    from victor.framework.debugging.execution import (
        ExecutionController,
        ExecutionState,
    )

    controller = ExecutionController(session_id="debug-123")

    # In workflow execution (DebugHook)
    if controller.should_pause(node_id, state):
        context = await controller.pause(node_id, state)
        # Execution waits here until resume

    # From debug client
    await controller.continue_execution()
