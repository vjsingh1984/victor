"""Task-related protocols for framework services.

This module defines protocols for task classification and budgeting.
These are framework-level services that can be used by any vertical.

Design Principles:
- SRP: Each protocol has a single responsibility
- DIP: Agent layer depends on protocols, not implementations
- ISP: Protocols are minimal and focused
