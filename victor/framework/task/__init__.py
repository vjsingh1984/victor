"""Framework task services module.

This module provides framework-level task classification and budgeting services.
These services are used by the agent layer but defined at the framework level
for reusability across all verticals.

Design Principles:
- SRP: Classification and budgets only (no prompt hints)
- DIP: Agent layer depends on protocols, not implementations
- Prompt hints are handled separately by the enrichment pipeline

Usage:
    from victor.framework.task import (
        TaskComplexity,
        TaskComplexityService,
        TaskClassification,
        classify_task,
    )

    # Using the service
    service = TaskComplexityService()
    result = service.classify("refactor authentication")
    print(f"Complexity: {result.complexity}, Budget: {result.tool_budget}")

    # Using convenience function
    result = classify_task("list all files")
    print(f"This is a {result.complexity.value} task")
