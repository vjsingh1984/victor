"""Agent protocols for multi-agent team coordination.

This module defines the core protocols and types for CrewAI-style multi-agent
orchestration in Victor. It provides:

- AgentCapability: Enum defining what agents can do (READ, WRITE, EXECUTE, etc.)
- MessageType: Enum for inter-agent message types
- AgentMessage: Dataclass for agent-to-agent communication
- IAgentRole: Protocol defining agent role contracts
- IAgentPersona: Protocol defining agent personality and style
- ITeamMember: Protocol for individual team members
- ITeamCoordinator: Protocol for team coordination
- TeamFormation: Enum for team organization patterns

NOTE: Types MessageType, AgentMessage, and TeamFormation are now imported from
victor.teams.types. This module re-exports them for backward compatibility.

Example:
    from victor.framework.agent_protocols import (
        AgentCapability,
        IAgentRole,
        TeamFormation,
    )

    # Check if a role has delegation capability
    if AgentCapability.DELEGATE in manager_role.capabilities:
        # Manager can delegate tasks to other agents
        pass

    # Configure team formation
    coordinator.set_formation(TeamFormation.HIERARCHICAL)
