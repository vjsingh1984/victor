"""Framework-level workspace utilities.

Provides ground-truth operations on a workspace's git state — capturing what
the agent changed, resetting to a known commit, etc. These are generic
capabilities useful across the framework (agentic loop, fulfillment detection,
evaluation, middleware, tools), not just the benchmark adapter.

Has ZERO victor-package dependencies (stdlib only) so any module can import it
without pulling in the orchestrator/tool/container dependency chain.

    """Capture the agent's file changes as a unified diff from the workspace's
    git state — the ground truth.

    Stages all changes (``git add -A``) then diffs staged vs HEAD
    (``git diff --cached HEAD``), capturing modified, new, AND deleted files.
    This is more reliable than hook-based edit-capture (which misses shell-based
    edits, stale snapshots, and some new files).

    Use cases:
    - Evaluation: the canonical patch source for final scoring + verify-and-retry.
    - Agentic loop: progress tracking ("what has the agent changed so far?").
    - Fulfillment detection: grounded "did the agent modify the relevant files?".
    - Middleware/observability: per-turn diff for debugging.

    Args:
        workspace: Path to the git workspace (the agent's working directory).
        timeout: Max seconds for each git subprocess.

    Returns:
        Unified diff string, or ``""`` if the workspace is not a git repo /
        git is unavailable.
