"""Search-novelty / diminishing-returns detection for the agentic loop.

Detects when an agent keeps searching the codebase but is finding mostly the *same* results —
the failure mode behind a "summarize the architecture" task that ran 31 distinct ``code_search``
calls without converging. The existing guards miss it: each query differs (so the
``SpinDetector`` signature differs) and the assistant content varies (so content-repetition
doesn't fire). The discriminator here is the per-turn *hit set*: a genuine multi-file task keeps
surfacing NEW ``(path, symbol)`` hits (novelty stays high), while a thrash re-surfaces the same
files (novelty collapses).

Import-clean: consumes only ``list[dict]`` tool results (the ``result_items`` attached by the
tool service), so both the headless and streaming loops can share one tracker via the
``TurnEvaluationController``.
