"""Reactive recovery modifier (ADR-013) — absorbs the existing failure escalation.

Wraps an injected :class:`ReactiveTemperatureAdjuster` (structurally satisfied by the agent-layer
``ProgressiveTemperatureAdjuster``: failure-type policies + Q-learning + per-model bounds). When a
reactive failure is active for the turn (``context.recovery_context`` set) it delegates; otherwise it
passes the value through. This unifies the previously-parallel recovery escalation path into the one
resolver rather than reimplementing it (the same adjuster instance is shared via DI, so Q-learning
state stays consistent with the recovery coordinator).
