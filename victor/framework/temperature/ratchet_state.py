"""Per-session ratchet state for the proactive spin-escape modifier (ADR-013).

The ratchet *count* is advanced ONLY by :meth:`RatchetState.record_turn` (called once per turn by the
loop), never by :meth:`SpinRatchetModifier.adjust`. This keeps ``adjust`` a pure function of
``(value, steps)`` — idempotent and safe to call repeatedly for tracing without double-stepping.
