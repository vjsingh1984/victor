"""Defaults + model bounds for the unified temperature policy (ADR-013).

Canonical home for the sampling-temperature constants so they live in exactly one place:
- ``GLOBAL_DEFAULT`` — the terminal fallback when no source resolves a base.
- ``DEFAULT_RATCHET_STEP`` / ``DEFAULT_RATCHET_CAP`` — the spin-escape ratchet parameters, grounded in
  arXiv 2606.01451 (coherence-flat region T≈0.3–0.8; degeneration cliff past T≈1.0 toward 1.5) so the
  step is modest and the cap stays well below 1.0.
- ``MODEL_TEMPERATURE_RANGES`` — per-model effective bounds (relocated from
  ``recovery/temperature.py``; that module now imports these back, eliminating the duplicate).
