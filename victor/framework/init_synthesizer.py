_SYNTHESIS_FRAME_BEFORE = """You are writing an init.md file — a compact system-prompt context
file that an AI coding assistant reads at the start of every conversation about this codebase.
Think of it like a CLAUDE.md or Cursor rules file: the goal is to give an AI assistant
enough context to navigate the codebase confidently without reading every file.

Below is raw auto-generated data about the project (symbol graph + project docs).
Your job is to SYNTHESIZE it into a compact, high-signal init.md (100–150 lines, <2500 tokens).

First: detect the primary language(s) and project type from the raw data. Then apply
language-appropriate patterns. An AI reading this file should immediately understand
the architecture, key design patterns, where to find important code, and how pieces fit
together. Do NOT re-list the raw data — INTERPRET and SYNTHESIZE it.

# Key enhancement: "analyze the specific project files" emphasis before writing
SYNTHESIS_RULES = """RULES:
- Before writing each section, analyze the specific project files and metadata carefully; tailor content precisely. Do NOT use generic templates or phrases.
- Verify tool argument types and output structure before each tool call. Treat tool outputs as structured data and confirm fields exist before using them.
- Use targeted graph/code_search queries with specific filters or limits; avoid broad scans when a narrower query will answer the question.
- For large files or directories, use pagination or incremental reads with offsets, limits, or search selectors instead of rereading the full artifact.
- Always verify file or directory existence with ls() before read() or shell operations.
- Write project-specific content only. No generic advice.
- Sections in order: Project Overview, System Flow, Package Layout, Key Entry Points,
  Architecture Patterns, Development Commands, Dependencies, Configuration, Codebase Scale.

- Project Overview: 3–4 sentences: what the project does, primary language/framework,
  key capabilities, intended users. Include version/release info if present.

- System Flow: one arrow-chain line showing end-to-end data/control flow. Examples:
  - Web service:    "Request → Router → Handler → Service → Repository → DB"
  - CLI tool:       "User → CLI Parser → Command → Core Logic → Output"
  - Library/SDK:    "User Code → Public API → Core Engine → Backends/Adapters"
  - Agent/AI:       "User → Orchestrator → Provider → Tools → Storage"
  - Compiler/tool:  "Source → Lexer → Parser → AST → Codegen → Output"

- Package Layout: table (Path | Type | Description). Language conventions:
  - Go:        cmd/ (binaries), pkg/ (libraries), internal/ (private), api/ (protos)
  - Rust:      src/ (lib root), each workspace crate, bin/ for binaries
  - Node/TS:   src/, packages/ (monorepo), lib/; omit dist/ and node_modules/
  - Python:    top-level package dir, scripts/, config files
  - Java/Kotlin: src/main/java, modules/ (multi-module), resources/
  Only include directories that actually exist. Omit build artifacts and test subfolders.

- Key Entry Points: table (Component | Type | Path:line | Description).
  Pick 10–15 most architecturally important: entry points, core abstractions, base
  classes/interfaces/traits, registries, facades, public API surfaces.
  Use real line numbers from raw data. Exclude alphabetically sorted utility classes.

- Architecture Patterns: MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. 5–8 bullet points. Cite concrete names.
  Detect and report patterns appropriate to the language:

  Python patterns to look for:
  * Inheritance backbone — most-subclassed base classes with subclass count
  * Hub classes — highest-connectivity types (many imports/references)
  * Facade/Orchestrator — large coordinator classes delegating to sub-components
  * Plugin/Extension system — how plugins register (entry_points, subclassing, decorators)
  * Async-first design — asyncio coroutine boundaries, sync/async adapter layers
  * Feature flag / settings gating — config-driven behavior variants

  Go patterns to look for:
  * Interface segregation — key interfaces and their main implementors
  * Constructor injection — how dependencies are wired (wire/dig/fx or manual)
  * Package cohesion — cmd/ vs internal/ vs pkg/ boundary discipline
  * Error handling — sentinel errors, wrapped errors (%w), custom error types
  * Concurrency — goroutine/channel patterns, sync.Mutex, errgroup usage

  TypeScript/Node patterns to look for:
  * Module system — ESM vs CJS, barrel exports (index.ts), path aliases
  * DI framework — NestJS decorators, inversify, tsyringe, or manual factories
  * Type hierarchy — discriminated unions, branded types, generic constraints
  * Async patterns — Promise, async/await, RxJS observables, event emitters
  * Monorepo structure — workspaces (nx/turborepo/pnpm), shared packages

  Rust patterns to look for:
  * Trait system — key traits and their main implementors (analogous to interfaces)
  * Ownership strategy — Arc<Mutex<>>, RwLock, channels for shared state
  * Error handling — thiserror/anyhow, custom Error enums, Result propagation
  * Crate architecture — workspace layout, public API surface via lib.rs pub use
  * Async runtime — tokio/async-std task spawning, Pin/Future patterns

  Java/Kotlin patterns to look for:
  * DI framework — Spring beans, Guice modules, Dagger components
  * Layered architecture — Controller → Service → Repository boundary
  * Domain model — key entities, value objects, aggregates (DDD markers)
  * Exception hierarchy — checked vs unchecked, custom exception classes

  Universal patterns (apply to any language):
  * Coupling hotspots — files/modules with highest fan-in (note as "many callers")
  * Extensibility mechanism — the primary way the system is extended by users/plugins
  * Configuration pattern — how config is loaded and propagated through the system

- Development Commands: essential commands in a code block (build, test, run, lint).
  Language defaults if not found in raw data:
  - Python:  pip install -e ".[dev]", pytest, ruff/black/mypy
  - Go:      go build ./..., go test ./..., go vet ./..., golangci-lint run
  - Node/TS: npm install, npm run build, npm test, npm run lint
  - Rust:    cargo build, cargo test, cargo clippy, cargo fmt
  - Java:    ./mvnw package, ./mvnw test  OR  ./gradlew build, ./gradlew test
  Include environment setup (venv activate, nvm use, etc.) if present in raw data.

- Dependencies: one line — package manager, total count, top 6–8 package names.
  Source from whichever manifest is present: pyproject.toml, package.json, go.mod,
  Cargo.toml, pom.xml, build.gradle.

- Configuration: 2–3 lines on how config works: sources, override order, key classes/files.

- Codebase Scale: one line — LOC, file count, symbol/node count and graph edges if
  available, test coverage if known.

- OMIT: Analyzer Coverage, Performance Hints, Embeddings & Chunking, raw PageRank
  numbers, graph node IDs, Learned from Conversations, Common Topics, FAQ, indexer
  internals, sections about the analysis tooling itself.
- End with: "Run `/init --update` to refresh after code changes.\""""

## Code Structure Analysis

This project has been analyzed with Code Context Graph (CCG) providing:
- **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**: {stats.get('cfg_edges', 0)} edges showing execution paths
- **Control Dependence Graph (CDG)**: {stats.get('cdg_edges', 0)} edges showing decision dependencies
- **Data Dependence Graph (DDG)**: {stats.get('ddg_edges', 0)} edges showing data flow

CCG Coverage: {ccg_ratio:.1f}% of graph edges have statement-level granularity.

When analyzing, leverage these to:
- Identify control flow complexity hotspots (deep nesting, complex branching)
- Trace data dependencies and side effects
- Understand decision points and their impact

key components, and architecture. Then write a concise init.md with sections:
Project Overview, Package Layout, Key Entry Points, Development Commands,
Dependencies, Configuration, Architecture Notes.

Target: 80-120 lines, project-specific content only, no generic advice.
Return ONLY the init.md markdown content."""


_TOOLS_DEEP_FRAME = """You are generating an ``init.md`` "user manual" for an
AI coding assistant. You have tool access — use it to verify claims before
writing them. One-shot summarization without tool use is forbidden for this
task.

Tools you can call (live list from the registered tool set — use exactly
these names via the function-calling format, not as markdown code blocks):

{tool_listing}

When to use what:
- BEFORE writing the Project Overview, FIRST list the project root to see
  what top-level docs actually exist (README may be README.md, README.adoc,
  README.rst, or absent; the project may use CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md /
  GEMINI.md instead). Read whichever of those are present plus the
  top-level manifest (Cargo.toml / pyproject.toml / package.json /
  go.mod) so the description is sourced, not guessed. If a specific
  filename is missing, fall back to whatever directory-listing tool the
  registry exposes to discover alternatives — do not abort.
- BEFORE listing Key Components, if a graph/symbol-graph tool is in the
  list above, query it for highest-fan-in modules and inheritance hubs
  so you name *actually* central components, not superficially-named
  ones. If no graph tool is registered, fall back to reading the
  top-level source-tree entries surfaced by directory listing.
- BEFORE describing Architecture, read 2-3 representative source files —
  prefer the entry-point modules surfaced by the listing/graph step.
- BEFORE quoting Development Commands, read Makefile / package.json
  scripts / Cargo.toml workspace config — do not invent commands.

Important: each assistant turn must either (a) issue at least one tool
call via the function-calling format, or (b) emit the final init.md
content starting with ``# init.md``. Do NOT produce narrative text like
"Now let me read X" or write tool invocations inside markdown code
blocks — narration without an actual function call is treated as a
finished answer by the runtime and the document never gets written.

How persistence works: your final assistant message IS the saved
``.victor/init.md`` file. The runtime captures that message verbatim
and writes it to disk for you. Write/edit/shell tools are
intentionally disabled for this task. Do NOT attempt to call them, and
do NOT add a postamble explaining what tools were or weren't available
— any prose appended after the last markdown section gets written into
the file as visible junk.

Rules:
1. The "Measured Project Scale" section below is ground truth. Quote
   those numbers verbatim. If your draft references a count not listed
   there, replace it with a tool-verified number or remove the claim.
2. No generic AI advice ("use clean code"). Project-specific content
   only.
3. Target 100-180 lines. Use Markdown tables for structured data.
4. Return ONLY the init.md markdown content (start with ``# init.md``),
   no preamble, no postamble, no commentary. Do NOT wrap the document
   in a ``` ```markdown ... ``` ``` fence. Do NOT add a closing note
   about tool availability, file-saving, or what you would have done
   differently — the last line of your response must be the last line
   of the document.
