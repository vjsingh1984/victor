"""Entity extraction pipeline for Victor memory system.

Provides extractors for different entity types:
- CodeEntityExtractor: Functions, classes, modules from code
- TextEntityExtractor: People, organizations, concepts from text
- CompositeExtractor: Combines multiple extractors

Example:
    extractor = CompositeExtractor([
        CodeEntityExtractor(),
        TextEntityExtractor(),
    ])
    entities = await extractor.extract(text, source="conversation")
