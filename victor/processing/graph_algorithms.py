"""Graph algorithms for code analysis using NetworkX.

This module provides graph algorithms for analyzing code structure:
- Centrality measures (PageRank, betweenness, etc.)
- Community detection
- Path finding
- Subgraph extraction

Note: NetworkX is an optional dependency. These functions gracefully
degrade if NetworkX is not available.
