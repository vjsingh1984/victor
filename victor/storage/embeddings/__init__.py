"""Shared embedding infrastructure for Victor.

This module provides a unified embedding service that supports:
- Tool selection (static, ~65 items)
- Intent classification (static, ~20 items)
- Code search (dynamic, via LanceDB - handled separately)

Design:
- Single EmbeddingService singleton to load the model once
- StaticEmbeddingCollection for pickle/numpy-backed small collections
- Cosine similarity for semantic matching

All imports are lazy to avoid pulling in numpy (optional dependency)
at ``import victor`` time.

def __getattr__(name: str):
    """Lazy-load submodule symbols on first access.

    This avoids importing numpy/sentence-transformers at module level,
    which would break ``import victor`` when those optional dependencies
    are not installed.
