"""Time-travel debugging via conversation state checkpoints.

This module provides LangGraph-style checkpoint functionality for conversation
state persistence, enabling replay, forking, branching, and debugging of agent sessions.

Key Features:
- Save/restore conversation state at any point
- Fork sessions from checkpoints to explore alternatives
- Diff checkpoints to understand state changes
- Auto-checkpoint every N tool calls
- SQLite backend for embedded persistence
- Tree-structured checkpoint navigation
- Named branches with merge capabilities
- Replay from any checkpoint

Usage - Basic Checkpointing:
    from victor.storage.checkpoints import ConversationCheckpointManager, SQLiteCheckpointBackend

    backend = SQLiteCheckpointBackend(storage_path)
    manager = ConversationCheckpointManager(backend)

    # Save checkpoint
    checkpoint_id = await manager.save_checkpoint(session_id, state, "before refactor")

    # List checkpoints
    checkpoints = await manager.list_checkpoints(session_id)

    # Restore state
    state = await manager.load_checkpoint(checkpoint_id)

    # Fork session
    new_state = await manager.fork_from_checkpoint(checkpoint_id, new_session_id)

Usage - Multi-Branch Workflows:
    from victor.storage.checkpoints import SQLiteCheckpointBackend
    from victor.storage.checkpoints.tree import BranchManager, CheckpointTree, MergeStrategy

    backend = SQLiteCheckpointBackend(storage_path)
    branch_mgr = BranchManager(backend)

    # Create experiment branch
    await branch_mgr.create_branch("experiment", session_id)
    await branch_mgr.checkout("experiment")

    # ... make changes, create checkpoints ...

    # Merge back to main
    result = await branch_mgr.merge("experiment", "main", session_id)

    # Visualize tree
    tree = await branch_mgr.get_tree(session_id)
    print(tree.to_ascii())
