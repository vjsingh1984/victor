"""Unified Symbol Store - SOLID-based facade for graph + semantic search.

This module provides a unified interface for code symbol storage and search,
combining graph-based relationships with semantic vector search.

Usage:
    from victor.storage.unified import create_symbol_store, SearchParams

    # Create default store (SQLite + LanceDB)
    store = create_symbol_store(repo_root=Path("."))
    await store.initialize()

    # Hybrid search
    results = await store.search(SearchParams(
        query="authentication handling",
        mode=SearchMode.HYBRID,
        limit=20,
    ))

    # Get symbol with relationships
    symbol = await store.get_symbol("symbol:victor/auth.py:authenticate")
    callers = await store.get_callers(symbol.unified_id)

Backend Options:
    # Default: SQLite + LanceDB (local, air-gapped compatible)
    store = create_symbol_store(backend="sqlite+lancedb")

    # PostgreSQL + pgvector (single store, cloud-ready)
    store = create_symbol_store(backend="postgres+pgvector", connection_string="...")

    # LanceDB only (vectors + metadata in single store)
    store = create_symbol_store(backend="lancedb")
