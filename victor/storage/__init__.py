"""Unified Storage Module for Victor.

This module consolidates all storage-related functionality into a single namespace:

- **cache**: Tiered caching with memory (L1) and disk (L2) layers
- **memory**: Multi-tier entity memory with unified coordinator
- **checkpoints**: Time-travel debugging via conversation state checkpoints
- **graph**: Generic graph storage with multiple backends
- **vector_stores**: Vector storage with multiple embedding providers
- **embeddings**: Shared embedding infrastructure and services
- **state**: Standalone state machine package

This restructuring provides:
1. Single import point for all storage functionality
2. Clear separation of concerns
3. Easier dependency management
4. Consistent API patterns across storage types

Example Usage:
    # Cache system
    from victor.storage.cache import get_cache_manager, CacheConfig

    # Memory system
    from victor.storage.memory import EntityMemory, get_memory_coordinator

    # Checkpoints
    from victor.storage.checkpoints import CheckpointManager, SQLiteCheckpointBackend

    # Graph storage
    from victor.storage.graph import create_graph_store, GraphNode

    # Vector stores
    from victor.storage.vector_stores import EmbeddingRegistry, EmbeddingConfig

    # Embeddings
    from victor.storage.embeddings import EmbeddingService

    # State machine
    from victor.storage.state import StateMachine, StateConfig
