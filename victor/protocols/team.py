"""Team coordination protocols (canonical location).

This module defines the protocols for team coordination in a neutral location
that both victor.teams and victor.framework can import from, breaking
circular dependencies.

Protocols:
    IAgent: Base agent protocol
    ITeamMember: Team member protocol
    ITeamCoordinator: Base coordinator protocol
    IObservableCoordinator: Observability capabilities
    IRLCoordinator: RL integration capabilities
    IMessageBusProvider: Message bus provider
    ISharedMemoryProvider: Shared memory provider
    IEnhancedTeamCoordinator: Combined capabilities

Design Principles:
    - ISP: Small, focused protocols that can be implemented independently
    - DIP: Depend on protocols, not concrete implementations
    - OCP: New capabilities added via new protocols, not modification
    - No circular dependencies: Both teams and framework import from here
