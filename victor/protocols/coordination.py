"""Coordination protocols for mode-team-workflow integration.

This module defines SOLID-compliant protocols for coordinating the selection
and suggestion of teams and workflows based on agent mode and task analysis.

Design Principles:
- Single Responsibility: Each protocol has one clear purpose
- Open/Closed: Extend via new implementations, not modifications
- Liskov Substitution: All implementations are interchangeable
- Interface Segregation: Small, focused protocols
- Dependency Inversion: Depend on protocols, not implementations

Architecture:
