"""IaC Scanner Module - Security scanning for Infrastructure-as-Code.

This module provides comprehensive security scanning for IaC files,
detecting misconfigurations, hardcoded secrets, and security issues.

Supported Platforms:
- Terraform (.tf, .tfvars)
- Docker (Dockerfile, *.dockerfile)
- Docker Compose (docker-compose.yml)
- Kubernetes (*.yaml, *.yml manifests)

Usage:
    from victor.iac import IaCManager

    manager = IaCManager("/path/to/project")
    result = await manager.scan()

    print(f"Found {len(result.findings)} security findings")
    for finding in result.findings:
        print(f"  [{finding.severity.value}] {finding.rule_id}: {finding.message}")
