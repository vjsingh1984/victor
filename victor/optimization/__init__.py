"""Workflow optimization algorithms for Victor.

This package provides automated workflow optimization capabilities including:
- Performance profiling and bottleneck detection
- Optimization strategies (pruning, parallelization, tool selection)
- Search algorithms (hill climbing, simulated annealing)
- Variant generation and evaluation
- Safety validation and rollback

Usage:
    from victor.optimization import WorkflowOptimizer

    optimizer = WorkflowOptimizer()
    profile = await optimizer.analyze_workflow(workflow_id)
    suggestions = await optimizer.suggest_optimizations(workflow_id)
