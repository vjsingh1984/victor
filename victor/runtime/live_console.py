"""Process-global registry for the console owning an active live display.

The interactive CLI's ``LiveDisplayRenderer`` registers its Rich console
around the display lifecycle. Consumers on both sides of the UI/agent
boundary read it:

- ``victor.ui.rendering.log_handler.LiveAwareLogHandler`` routes console log
  records through the live console so they print above the Live region.
- ``victor.agent.services.tool_service`` suppresses its direct console error
  print while a live renderer is active (the renderer already surfaces the
  failure as an error card).

Living in ``victor.runtime`` keeps the agent layer free of UI imports: the
registry stores the console as an opaque object and never imports rich.
