"""Edge-classifier ML core (FEP-0012).

Versioned feature extraction + a shipped linear-head artifact + pure-numpy
inference. The *training* side (``trainer.py``) uses sklearn and is a DEV-only
dependency; the runtime (features + model) needs only numpy.

See FEP-0012 and ``victor/ml/features.py`` for the versioning contract.
