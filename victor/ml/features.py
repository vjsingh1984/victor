"""Versioned feature extraction for the edge classifier (FEP-0012).

Hashing-trick features (char + word n-grams) projected into a fixed-size space.
Deterministic **across processes** (uses hashlib, not Python's randomized
``hash()``) so a model trained offline consumes the exact same features at
online inference time, and the per-project RL delta updates the right hashes.

The whole config — hash space, n-gram sizes, normalization — is pinned by
``FEATURE_SPEC_VERSION``. A model trained on spec vN only consumes vN features;
if the spec changes, old deltas are invalidated (migrated/zeroed). This is the
robustness contract for offline training / online inference / online RL all
agreeing on the feature space.
