"""Sandhi model-catalog consumption (TD-0004 Phase A).

Sandhi owns catalog **data** -- curated, versioned model facts (id, context
window, max output; no pricing) exposed via
``sandhi_gateway.provider_models_json``. Victor owns catalog **policy**: this
module shapes the neutral ``ModelDescriptorV1`` facts into Victor's model-dict
surface, and every consumer (Anthropic/OpenAI/Google provider shells) falls
back to its own SDK discovery / static list when the installed Sandhi binding
predates the catalog surface.
