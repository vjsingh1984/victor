"""FEP-0020 Phase 4 — route provider egress through a ``sandhi`` gateway.

The "provider transport migration" (ADR-0047 D10), OpenAI-compat first. Instead
of hitting the provider's real endpoint directly, Victor points its **existing**
OpenAI-compatible provider at a running ``sandhi`` usage gateway (Phase 3,
``victor gateway serve``) and authenticates with a per-user **virtual key**. The
gateway resolves the key to a subject/team, enforces the token budget, forwards
to the real upstream holding the shared key, and meters usage per subject.

Only the *egress endpoint* changes — Victor keeps its Python adapter, so prompt
assembly, tool translation, FEP-0011 hints, agent-aware selection, and
**streaming** all work unchanged (the gateway passes SSE through byte-for-byte).
Routing is opt-in (``GatewayRoute.enabled``); the default path is direct, so this
is non-breaking.

Scope note (ADR-0047 D10). This ships the OpenAI-compat *endpoint reroute*, which
covers OpenAI proper plus the ~20 providers that speak the Chat Completions wire
format, with full streaming. Migrating Victor's in-process adapters onto the
Rust ``sandhi-providers`` transport directly (via a PyO3 async binding) is the
**deferred tail** of D10 — its incremental value over metering (Phase 2) + the
reverse proxy (Phase 3) is marginal, and bridging streaming Rust futures across
PyO3 is costly; it stays a named-trigger deferral.
