"""Sandhi usage-gateway bridge (FEP-0020 Phase 2).

Victor computes local USD cost per session but historically had **no per-user /
per-team attribution and no shared metering mechanism**. Rather than reimplement
metering, Victor adopts the standalone open-core gateway ``sandhi`` (Apache-2.0,
``anvai-labs/sandhi``; see AnvaiOps ADR-0047 / Victor ADR-018): the OSS core owns
the neutral usage-event *mechanism*, Victor supplies the *attribution* (which user,
which team) drawn from its identity/auth seam.

This module is the thin in-process bridge — the Phase 2 "metering middleware"
adoption. Each completed provider call is metered against a per-subject virtual
key, producing exactly one neutral usage event (with the full prompt-cache split)
that lands in ``sandhi``'s local sink.

The dependency is **optional and default-off**: ``sandhi-gateway`` lives behind the
``victor[sandhi]`` extra. When it is not installed, :func:`sandhi_available` returns
``False`` and callers skip the bridge — the base install is byte-for-byte unaffected
(FEP-0020 "Migration Path": ships default-off, zero behavior change).
