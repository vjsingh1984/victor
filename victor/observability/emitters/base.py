"""Base emitter interface for observability events.

This module defines the Protocol-based interfaces for event emitters,
following the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) from SOLID.
Each emitter has a focused, single-responsibility interface.

NOTE: These protocols define the high-level emitter API. The underlying
event system uses the canonical Event class with topic-based routing,
but these protocols provide type-safe domain-specific methods.
