"""Event debouncing framework for Victor observability.

This module provides adaptive debouncing strategies for high-frequency events
to prevent log bloat and improve performance.

Design Patterns:
- Strategy Pattern: Pluggable debouncing strategies
- Decorator Pattern: Debouncer wraps event emission
- Event-Driven Architecture: Time-based and count-based filtering

Example:
    >>> from victor.observability.debouncing import SessionStartDebouncer, DebounceConfig
    >>> config = DebounceConfig(window_seconds=5, max_events_per_window=3)
    >>> debouncer = SessionStartDebouncer(config)
    >>> if debouncer.should_emit(session_id, metadata):
    ...     emit_event()
    ...     debouncer.record(session_id, metadata)
