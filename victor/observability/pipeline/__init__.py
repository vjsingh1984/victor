"""Pipeline Analytics Module - CI/CD and coverage analysis for Victor.

This module provides comprehensive analytics for CI/CD pipelines and
code coverage tracking. It supports multiple platforms and formats:

CI/CD Platforms:
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI
- Jenkins (planned)
- CircleCI (planned)
- Azure DevOps (planned)
- Bitbucket Pipelines (planned)

Coverage Formats:
- Cobertura XML
- LCOV
- JaCoCo XML

Usage:
    from victor.observability.pipeline import PipelineManager

    manager = PipelineManager("/path/to/project")
    result = await manager.analyze_pipelines()

    print(f"Found {len(result.configs)} pipeline configs")
    print(f"Issues: {len(result.issues)}")
    for rec in result.recommendations:
        print(f"  - {rec}")
