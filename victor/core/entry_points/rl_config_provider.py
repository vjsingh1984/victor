"""RL Config Provider Protocol.

This protocol defines the interface that vertical packages must implement
to register their reinforcement learning configuration with the Victor framework.

Verticals register RL configs via the `victor.rl_configs` entry point group.
Each registration function should conform to this protocol.

    """Protocol for RL configuration provider factory functions.

    RL configuration provider factory functions are called by the framework to
    obtain vertical-specific RL configurations. These functions are registered
    via the `victor.rl_configs` entry point group.

    The function signature must be:
        def get_rl_config() -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]

    Example:
        # In victor_coding/rl/config.py:
        def get_rl_config() -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
