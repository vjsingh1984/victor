"""Tool Dependency Provider Protocol.

This protocol defines the interface that vertical packages must implement
to register their tool dependency providers with the Victor framework.

Verticals register tool dependency providers via the `victor.tool_dependencies`
entry point group. Each registration function should conform to this protocol.

    """Protocol for tool dependency provider factory functions.

    Tool dependency provider factory functions are called by the framework to
    obtain vertical-specific tool dependency providers. These functions are
    registered via the `victor.tool_dependencies` entry point group.

    The function signature must be:
        def get_provider() -> BaseToolDependencyProvider

    Example:
        # In victor_coding/tool_dependencies.py:
        def get_provider() -> BaseToolDependencyProvider:
            \"\"\"Return tool dependency provider for coding vertical.\"\"\"

                canonicalize=True,
            )

        # In victor-coding/pyproject.toml:
        [project.entry-points."victor.tool_dependencies"]
        coding = "victor_coding.tool_dependencies:get_provider"

        # Framework usage:
        from importlib.metadata import entry_points
        eps = entry_points(group="victor.tool_dependencies")
        for ep in eps:
            if ep.name == "coding":
