"""Command Provider Protocol.

This protocol defines the interface that vertical packages must implement
to register their CLI commands with the Victor framework.

Verticals register CLI commands via the `victor.commands` entry point group.
Each registration function should conform to this protocol.

    """Protocol for CLI command registration functions.

    Command registration functions are called by the framework to register
    vertical-specific CLI commands. These functions are registered via the
    `victor.commands` entry point group.

    The function signature must be:
        def register_commands(app: typer.Typer) -> None

    Example:
        # In victor_coding/ui/commands/check_codebase_index.py:
        def register_commands(app: typer.Typer) -> None:
            \"\"\"Register coding-specific CLI commands.\"\"\"
            @app.command()
            def check_codebase_index(
                path: str = ".",
                verbose: bool = False,
            ):
                \"\"\"Check the codebase index status.\"\"\"
                from victor_coding.codebase.indexer import CodebaseIndex
                index = CodebaseIndex(path)
                status = index.check_status()
                if verbose:
                    print(status.details)
                else:
                    print(status.summary)

        # In victor-coding/pyproject.toml:
        [project.entry-points."victor.commands"]
        check_codebase_index = "victor_coding.ui.commands.check_codebase_index:register_commands"

        # Framework usage:
        from importlib.metadata import entry_points
        app = typer.Typer()
        for ep in entry_points(group="victor.commands"):
