"""Entry point protocol definitions for Victor extensibility.

This module defines the protocols that vertical packages must implement
to register their capabilities with the Victor framework via entry points.

Entry Point Groups:
    victor.verticals           - Vertical assistant classes
    victor.safety_rules        - Safety rule registration functions
    victor.tool_dependencies  - Tool dependency provider factories
    victor.rl_configs          - RL configuration provider factories
    victor.escape_hatches     - Escape hatch registration functions
    victor.commands            - CLI command registration functions

Example:
    # In victor-coding/pyproject.toml:
    [project.entry-points."victor.safety_rules"]
    coding = "victor_coding.safety:register_coding_safety_rules"

    # In victor_coding/safety.py:
    def register_coding_safety_rules(enforcer: SafetyEnforcer) -> None:
        enforcer.register_rule(CodingFileOperationRule())
        enforcer.register_rule(CodingGitOperationRule())
