"""Safety Rule Provider Protocol.

This protocol defines the interface that vertical packages must implement
to register their safety rules with the Victor framework.

Verticals register safety rules via the `victor.safety_rules` entry point group.
Each registration function should conform to this protocol.

    """Protocol for safety rule registration functions.

    Safety rule registration functions are called by the framework to
    register vertical-specific safety rules. These functions are registered
    via the `victor.safety_rules` entry point group.

    The function signature must be:
        def register_<vertical>_safety_rules(enforcer: SafetyEnforcer) -> None

    Example:
        # In victor_rag/safety.py:
        def register_rag_safety_rules(enforcer: SafetyEnforcer) -> None:
            \"\"\"Register RAG-specific safety rules with the enforcer.\"\"\"
            enforcer.register_rule(RAGDeletionRule())
            enforcer.register_rule(RAGIngestionRule())

        # In victor-rag/pyproject.toml:
        [project.entry-points."victor.safety_rules"]
        rag = "victor_rag.safety:register_rag_safety_rules"

        # Framework usage:
        from importlib.metadata import entry_points
        enforcer = SafetyEnforcer()
        for ep in entry_points(group="victor.safety_rules"):
            register_func = ep.load()
