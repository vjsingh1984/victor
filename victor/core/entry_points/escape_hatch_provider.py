"""Escape Hatch Provider Protocol.

This protocol defines the interface that vertical packages must implement
to register their escape hatches with the Victor framework.

Verticals register escape hatches via the `victor.escape_hatches` entry point
group. Each registration function should conform to this protocol.

    """Protocol for escape hatch registration functions.

    Escape hatch registration functions are called by the framework to
    register vertical-specific escape hatches. These functions are registered
    via the `victor.escape_hatches` entry point group.

    The function signature must be:
        def register_escape_hatches(registry: EscapeHatchRegistry) -> None

    Example:
        # In victor_coding/escape_hatches.py:
        def register_escape_hatches(registry: EscapeHatchRegistry) -> None:
            \"\"\"Register coding-specific escape hatches.\"\"\"

                safety_check=lambda: check_sandbox_available(),
            )

        # In victor-coding/pyproject.toml:
        [project.entry-points."victor.escape_hatches"]
        coding = "victor_coding.escape_hatches:register_escape_hatches"

        # Framework usage:
        from importlib.metadata import entry_points
        registry = EscapeHatchRegistry()
        for ep in entry_points(group="victor.escape_hatches"):
            register_func = ep.load()
