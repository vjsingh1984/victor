"""Unified safety scanner registry for cross-vertical safety scanning.

This module provides a central registry for safety scanners across all domains
(secrets, PII, code patterns, infrastructure), enabling:
- Pluggable scanner registration per domain
- Unified scan_all for comprehensive safety checks
- Extension without modification (OCP principle)

Example usage:
    from victor.security.safety.registry import SafetyRegistry, ISafetyScanner
    from victor.security.safety.secrets import SecretScanner
    from victor.security.safety.pii import PIIScanner

    # Create registry
    registry = SafetyRegistry()

    # Register domain-specific scanners
    registry.register("secrets", SecretScanner())
    registry.register("pii", PIIScanner())

    # Scan content across all domains
    findings = registry.scan_all(code_content)
    for finding in findings:
        print(f"Issue: {finding}")

    # Get specific scanner
    secret_scanner = registry.get_scanner("secrets")
    if secret_scanner:
        results = secret_scanner.scan(content)
