"""Language-specific edge detection handlers.

MIGRATION COMPLETE:
All edge detection has been migrated to victor_coding language plugins.
This package is now empty - use victor_coding.plugins for language-specific
edge detection implementations.

The victor-ai core now discovers and uses victor_coding plugins via:
- victor.core.graph_rag.language_handlers._get_victor_coding_handler()
- victor_coding.languages.registry.get_plugin_by_language()
