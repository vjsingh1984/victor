"""Graph indexing pipeline - G-Indexing stage of Graph RAG.

This module implements the first stage of the Graph RAG pipeline:
building a rich code graph with embeddings for semantic retrieval.

Based on GraphRAG methodology:
1. Build symbol graph from code structure
2. Build CCG (optional) for statement-level granularity
3. Generate embeddings for nodes
4. Cache subgraphs for efficient retrieval

ARCHITECTURAL SEAM (2026-04-29):
Language-specific edge detection should be handled by per-language
handlers implementing the LanguageEdgeHandler protocol. See
language_handlers.py for the protocol and handlers/ directory
for implementations.

MIGRATION STATUS:
- Core indexing pipeline: Uses language handlers via get_edge_handler()
- Fallback: Legacy _build_calls_edges() for unsupported languages
- Target: All edge detection moved to victor-coding language plugins

Future sessions: Add handlers for new languages in handlers/ directory,
then move them to victor-coding package as part of language plugins.
