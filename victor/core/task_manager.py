"""Task Manager - Mixin for managing background tasks with proper cleanup.

This module provides a reusable mixin for tracking asyncio background tasks
and ensuring proper cleanup to prevent resource leaks.

Design Pattern: Mixin
- Provides task tracking functionality to any class
- Manages task lifecycle (creation, tracking, cleanup)
- Handles exceptions in background tasks

Usage:
    class MyComponent(TaskManager):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            # Component initialization

        async def start(self):
            # Create tracked background task
            self.create_tracked_task(
                self._background_worker(),
                name="background_worker"
            )

        async def shutdown(self):
            # Clean up all tasks
            await self.cleanup_tasks()

Example:
    component = MyComponent()
    await component.start()
    # ... do work ...
    await component.shutdown()  # Ensures all tasks are cancelled and awaited
