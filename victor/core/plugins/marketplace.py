"""Plugin marketplace registry for discovery and search.

Provides a registry of known plugins that can be searched and installed
via ``victor plugin search`` and ``victor plugin install``.

Discovery sources (in priority order):
1. Entry points: ``victor.marketplace`` group (installed packages self-register)
2. Fallback: Built-in list for packages that haven't added entry points yet

Verticals register marketplace metadata via pyproject.toml::

    [project.entry-points."victor.marketplace"]
    victor-coding = "victor_coding:MARKETPLACE_ENTRY"
