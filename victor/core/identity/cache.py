"""Caching decorator for any :class:`TokenCredential`.

Caching is a cross-cutting concern, so it is a *decorator* (Open/Closed): it
wraps any credential without that credential — or its consumers — knowing about
it. Tokens are cached per scope-set and refreshed ahead of expiry; concurrent
refreshers are coalesced under a lock so a token stampede mints only once.
