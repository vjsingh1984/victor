"""Provider-agnostic token-credential abstraction.

This is the *only* type that token consumers (transports, tools, providers)
should depend on. Concrete credential flows (client-credentials, managed
identity, a pre-supplied token, ...) live in :mod:`victor.core.identity.sources`
and are interchangeable behind :class:`TokenCredential` (Liskov). The shape
deliberately mirrors ``azure.core.credentials.AccessToken`` /
``azure.core.credentials_async.AsyncTokenCredential`` so this layer stays
compatible with the cloud-native standard and could delegate to
``azure-identity`` later without changing any caller.
