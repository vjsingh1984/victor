"""Declarative bootstrap phase DAG for service container initialization.

Replaces the implicit ordering in bootstrap_container() with an explicit
dependency graph. Each phase declares its dependencies, and execution
follows a topological sort to ensure correct ordering.

Usage:
    from victor.core.bootstrap_phases import BOOTSTRAP_PHASES, execute_phases

    execute_phases(BOOTSTRAP_PHASES, container, settings, active_vertical)
