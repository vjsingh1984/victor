"""Query Rewrite Strategy.

Reformulates queries for better search/retrieval using LLM by:
- Expanding abbreviations and acronyms
- Adding relevant synonyms
- Normalizing terminology
- Maintaining focus on original intent

Domain-specific templates handle different vocabulary:
- Financial: Expand tickers (AAPL → Apple Inc), abbreviations (rev → revenue)
- Code: Expand code terms (fn → function, impl → implementation)
- Research: Academic terminology normalization
- General: Basic query optimization
