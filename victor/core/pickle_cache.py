"""Shared load-validate-save helper for metadata-wrapped pickle caches.

Several components persist small derived datasets (tool embeddings, static
collection embeddings) as a single pickled ``dict`` that wraps both the payload
and validation metadata (cache version, content hash, embedding model, embedding
dimensions). They all follow the same lifecycle:

1. Load the pickle if the file exists.
2. Run an ordered sequence of validators (version, hash, model, dims,
   integrity). Each validator decides whether the cache is valid and, if not,
   whether the stale cache file should be deleted.
3. Delete the file and return ``None`` on any unpickling/generic error.
4. Save the payload plus metadata back to disk.

This module extracts that shared flow. It is deliberately minimal: it owns only
the file I/O, the delete-on-mismatch bookkeeping, and the exception handling.
The per-site validation semantics are supplied by callers as validator
callables, so each site keeps its exact checks, order, and on-mismatch
behavior.
