"""Helpers for keeping log records bounded in size.

Error-path logs interpolate provider response bodies and exception text, which
can be arbitrarily large (a full HTTP error body, a multi-kilobyte traceback).
Emitted at ERROR/WARNING they survive log-level filtering, so a stuck loop that
spins on an error path can write those bodies to a redirected log unbounded.
``truncate_for_log`` caps that content to a sane ceiling while preserving how
much was elided (see TD-20 in docs/tech-stack.md).

        ``limit`` characters followed by a ``… (+N more chars)`` marker so the
