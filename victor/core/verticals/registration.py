"""Compatibility wrapper around the SDK vertical registration contract.

The canonical definition-layer decorator now lives in ``victor_sdk``.
This module remains for in-repo and incremental migration compatibility while
preserving the extra runtime side effects core expects:

- attach an SDK manifest
- register the decorated class with ``VerticalRegistry`` when available
- register the derived behavior configuration with ``VerticalBehaviorConfigRegistry``
