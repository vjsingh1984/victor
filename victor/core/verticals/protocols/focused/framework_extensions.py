"""Framework Extensions Protocol (ISP: Interface Segregation Principle).

This module contains the focused protocol for framework-related extensions.
Following ISP, this protocol contains ONLY framework-related fields:
- workflow_provider: Workflow management
- rl_config_provider: Reinforcement learning configuration
- team_spec_provider: Multi-agent team specifications

This protocol splits the fat VerticalExtensions interface into a focused
subset, allowing components to depend only on the framework extensions
they actually need.

Usage:
    from victor.core.verticals.protocols.focused.framework_extensions import (
        FrameworkExtensionsProtocol,
    )

    class WorkflowEngine:
        def __init__(self, extensions: FrameworkExtensionsProtocol):
            # Can access workflow, rl_config, and team_spec providers
            self.workflow = extensions.workflow_provider
            self.rl_config = extensions.rl_config_provider
"""

class FrameworkExtensionsProtocol(Protocol):
    """Focused protocol for framework-related vertical extensions.

    This protocol contains ONLY framework-related fields extracted from
    the fat VerticalExtensions interface for ISP compliance:
    - workflow_provider: Workflow definitions and management
    - rl_config_provider: RL learner configurations and quality thresholds
    - team_spec_provider: Multi-agent team specifications

    Components that only need framework extensions can depend on this
    protocol instead of the full VerticalExtensions, reducing coupling
    and adhering to the Interface Segregation Principle.

    Example:
        class WorkflowIntegration:
            def __init__(
                self,
                extensions: FrameworkExtensionsProtocol,
            ):
                # Only access framework-related fields
                self.workflow = extensions.workflow_provider
                self.rl_config = extensions.rl_config_provider
                self.team_spec = extensions.team_spec_provider

    Note:
        All fields are Optional to support verticals that don't provide
        all framework extensions.
