"""Safety Extensions Protocol (ISP-Compliant).

This module provides a focused protocol for safety-related vertical extensions,
following the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP). It extracts safety-specific
concerns from the larger VerticalExtensions interface.

This protocol allows verticals to provide domain-specific safety patterns for
dangerous operations like bash commands and file operations.

Usage:
    from victor.core.verticals.protocols.focused.safety_extensions import (
        SafetyExtensionsProtocol,
    )

    class CodingSafetyExtensions(SafetyExtensionsProtocol):
        def get_safety_extensions(self) -> List[SafetyExtensionProtocol]:
            return [GitSafetyExtension(), DockerSafetyExtension()]

    # Get all safety patterns
    extensions = CodingSafetyExtensions()
    patterns = extensions.get_all_safety_patterns()

    This focused protocol allows verticals to provide domain-specific

    Verticals can register patterns for dangerous bash commands,
