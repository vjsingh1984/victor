"""Middleware Protocols (ISP: Interface Segregation Principle).

This module contains protocols specifically for tool execution middleware.
Following ISP, these protocols are focused on a single responsibility:
intercepting and modifying tool calls.

Usage:
    from victor.core.verticals.protocols.middleware import (
        MiddlewareProtocol,
    )

    class CodeValidationMiddleware(MiddlewareProtocol):
        async def before_tool_call(
            self, tool_name: str, arguments: Dict[str, Any]
        ) -> MiddlewareResult:
            if tool_name == "write_file":
                # Validate code before writing
                ...
            return MiddlewareResult()
"""
