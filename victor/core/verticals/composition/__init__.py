"""Vertical composition framework.

This package provides composition-based architecture for building
verticals, following the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) and
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).

Instead of inheriting from VerticalBase and being forced to
implement or override many methods, verticals can now be built
by composing together only the capabilities they need.

Key Features:
- BaseComposer: Foundation for composing capabilities
- CapabilityComposer: Compose vertical capabilities declaratively
- Capability Providers: Focused, single-responsibility capability classes

Example:
    MyVertical = (
        VerticalBase
        .compose()
        .with_metadata("my_vertical", "My assistant", "1.0.0")
        .with_stages(custom_stages)
        .with_extensions([SafetyExtension(), LoggingExtension()])
        .build()
    )
