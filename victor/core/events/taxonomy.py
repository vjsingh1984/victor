"""Unified event taxonomy registry.

Maps domain-specific event type enums (WorkflowEventType, TeamEventType,
AuditEventType, etc.) to the canonical ``EventType`` from
``victor.framework.events`` without merging the enums themselves.

This enables:
- Discovery of all event types across domains
- Correlation between domain events and canonical types
- Reverse lookup: which domain events map to a given canonical type

Usage::

    from victor.core.events.taxonomy import EventTaxonomyRegistry
    from victor.framework.events import EventType

    EventTaxonomyRegistry.register_domain(
        "workflow",
        WorkflowEventType,
        {
            WorkflowEventType.AGENT_CONTENT: EventType.CONTENT,
            WorkflowEventType.AGENT_ERROR: EventType.ERROR,
        },
    )

    canonical = EventTaxonomyRegistry.to_canonical(
        "workflow", WorkflowEventType.AGENT_CONTENT
    )  # → EventType.CONTENT
