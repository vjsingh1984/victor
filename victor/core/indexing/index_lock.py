"""Index-level locking to prevent concurrent indexing of same path.

This module provides per-path async locking to prevent multiple concurrent
indexing operations on the same codebase path. Uses singleton pattern with
double-checked locking for thread-safe access.

Provides two levels of locking:
1. In-process locking (asyncio.Lock) - prevents concurrent indexing in same process
2. Cross-process locking (file-based) - prevents concurrent indexing across processes

Pattern: Singleton + Per-Resource Locking + Double-Checked Locking + File Locking
