"""Document chunking module for Victor core.

Provides intelligent document chunking with multiple strategies:
- Text: Sentence-boundary aware chunking
- HTML: Semantic structure (paragraphs, sections, tables)
- JSON: Object/array boundary preservation
- Markdown: Header-based sections
- Code: Function/class boundary detection

Example:
    from victor.core.chunking import chunk_document, ChunkingConfig

    # Auto-detect document type from source
    chunks = chunk_document(
        content=html_content,
        source="https://sec.gov/filing.htm"
    )

    # Explicit type with custom config
    config = ChunkingConfig(chunk_size=1024, chunk_overlap=100)
    chunks = chunk_document(
        content=json_content,
        doc_type="json",
        config=config
    )

    # Use registry directly for more control
    from victor.core.chunking import ChunkingRegistry

    registry = ChunkingRegistry()
    strategy = registry.get_strategy("html")
    chunks = strategy.chunk(html_content)
