"""Safety extensions for Victor verticals.

Provides base classes and utilities for implementing enhanced safety
in verticals. Verticals can inherit from BaseSafetyExtension to get
common safety functionality while adding vertical-specific rules.

Usage:
    from victor.contrib.safety import BaseSafetyExtension, SafetyContext

    class MyVerticalSafetyExtension(BaseSafetyExtension):
        def get_vertical_name(self) -> str:
            return "myvertical"

        def get_vertical_rules(self) -> List[SafetyPattern]:
            return [
                SafetyPattern(
                    name="myvertical-dangerous-operation",
                    pattern=r"rm -rf /",
                    description="Dangerous file deletion",
                    severity=SafetySeverity.DANGER,
                    allowed_envs=["testing"],
                )
            ]
