"""Workflow escape hatch base classes for Victor verticals.

Provides base classes and utilities for implementing YAML workflow
support in verticals. Verticals can inherit from BaseWorkflowProvider
to get common workflow functionality while adding vertical-specific
workflows.

Usage:
    from victor.contrib.workflows import BaseWorkflowProvider

    class MyVerticalWorkflowProvider(BaseWorkflowProvider):
        def get_vertical_name(self) -> str:
            return \"myvertical\"

        def get_workflow_directories(self) -> List[str]:
            return [
                \"/usr/local/lib/victor-workflows/common\",
                \"~/.victor/workflows/myvertical\",
            ]
"""

from victor.contrib.workflows.base_provider import BaseWorkflowProvider
from victor.contrib.workflows.workflow_loader import WorkflowLoaderMixin

__all__ = [
