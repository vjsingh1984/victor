"""Testing utilities for Victor verticals.

Provides base classes and utilities for implementing tests
in verticals. Verticals can use these utilities to avoid
duplicating test code across verticals.

Usage:
    from victor.contrib.testing import VerticalTestCase, MockProviderMixin

    class TestMyVertical(VerticalTestCase, MockProviderMixin):
        vertical_name = \"myvertical\"

        def test_vertical_initialization(self):
            assistant = self.create_vertical_assistant()
            self.assertIsNotNone(assistant)
"""

from victor.contrib.testing.base_test import VerticalTestCase
from victor.contrib.testing.fixtures import (
    MockProviderMixin,
    TestAssistantMixin,

)

__all__ = [
