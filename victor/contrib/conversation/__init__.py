"""Enhanced conversation management for Victor verticals.

Provides base classes and utilities for implementing enhanced conversation
management in verticals. Verticals can inherit from BaseConversationManager
to get common conversation functionality while adding vertical-specific features.

Usage:
    from victor.contrib.conversation import BaseConversationManager

    class MyVerticalConversationManager(BaseConversationManager):
        def get_vertical_name(self) -> str:
            return "myvertical"

        def get_system_prompt(self) -> str:
            return "You are a helpful assistant for myvertical."
"""

from victor.contrib.conversation.base_manager import BaseConversationManager
from victor.contrib.conversation.vertical_context import VerticalConversationContext

__all__ = [
    "BaseConversationManager",
    "VerticalConversationContext",
]
