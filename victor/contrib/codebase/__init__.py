Codebase analysis utilities for Victor verticals.

This contrib package provides shared codebase analysis functionality that can
be used by multiple verticals without creating framework-to-vertical dependencies.

Components:
- BasicCodebaseAnalyzer: Simple file-based codebase analyzer
- Pattern matching for common constructs (classes, functions, imports)

Usage:
    from victor.contrib.codebase import BasicCodebaseAnalyzer

    analyzer = BasicCodebaseAnalyzer()
    analysis = await analyzer.analyze_codebase(
        root_path=Path("/path/to/code"),
        include_patterns=["**/*.py"],
    )
"""

from victor.contrib.codebase.analyzer import BasicCodebaseAnalyzer

__all__ = [
    "BasicCodebaseAnalyzer",
]
