File editing utilities for Victor verticals.

This contrib package provides shared file editing functionality that can
be used by multiple verticals without creating framework-to-vertical
dependencies.

- DiffEditor: Default diff-based file editor implementation
- EditValidator: Standalone edit validation utility

Usage:
    from victor.contrib.editing import DiffEditor

    editor = DiffEditor()
    result = await editor.edit_file(
        file_path="/path/to/file.py",
        edits=[EditOperation(old_str="old", new_str="new")],
    )
"""

from victor.contrib.editing.diff_editor import DiffEditor
