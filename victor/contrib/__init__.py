"""Victor Contrib - Shared optional packages for verticals.

This package contains reusable components that are shared across multiple
verticals but are not part of the core framework. These packages provide
ready-made functionality that verticals can consume to avoid code duplication.

Architecture:
- Core (victor/): Essential framework (Agent, StateGraph, Tools, Events)
- Contrib (victor/contrib/): Shared optional packages for verticals
- Verticals (victor-xyz/): Domain-specific implementations

Contrib Packages:
- safety: Enhanced safety extensions for all verticals
- conversation: Enhanced conversation management for all verticals
- workflows: YAML workflow escape hatch base classes
- mode_config: Mode configuration provider base classes
- testing: Common testing utilities for verticals

Usage:
    # In a vertical (e.g., victor-devops)
    from victor.contrib.safety import BaseSafetyExtension
    from victor.contrib.conversation import BaseConversationManager

    class DevOpsSafetyExtension(BaseSafetyExtension):
        def get_vertical_name(self) -> str:
            return "devops"

        def get_vertical_rules(self) -> List[SafetyPattern]:
            # DevOps-specific safety rules
            return [...]
