Language Server Protocol utilities for Victor verticals.

This contrib package provides shared LSP functionality that can
be used by multiple verticals without creating framework-to-vertical dependencies.

Components:
- BasicLSPClient: Simple LSP client stub for when full LSP is unavailable

Note: Full LSP integration requires victor-coding package. This package
provides protocol definitions and basic stubs for graceful degradation.

Usage:
    from victor.contrib.lsp import BasicLSPClient

    lsp = BasicLSPClient()
    # Returns empty results - full LSP requires victor-coding
    completions = await lsp.get_completions(file_path, line, char)
"""

from victor.contrib.lsp.client import BasicLSPClient

__all__ = [
    "BasicLSPClient",
