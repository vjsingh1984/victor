"""Victor runtime vertical compatibility package.

This module exists primarily for runtime consumption and backward compatibility.
Historically it exposed in-repo and contrib vertical implementations directly, and
those imports remain available for compatibility and internal runtime integration.

New external vertical packages should not be authored against ``victor.verticals``.
Instead:
- define verticals against ``victor_sdk.VerticalBase``
- decorate them with ``victor_sdk.register_vertical``
- publish a thin ``VictorPlugin`` through the canonical ``victor.plugins``
  entry-point group

Core runtime loading, activation, and compatibility handling now live under
``victor.core.verticals``.
