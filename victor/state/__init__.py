"""Unified state management system.

This package provides unified state management across the Victor framework,
replacing fragmented state systems (ExecutionContext, ConversationStateMachine,
TeamContext, CopyOnWriteState) with a single, consistent API.

Architecture:
- IStateManager protocol: Canonical interface for all state managers
- StateScope enum: Four scopes (WORKFLOW, CONVERSATION, TEAM, GLOBAL)
- StateTracer: Records state transitions for debugging
- GlobalStateManager: Unified facade for all scopes

SOLID Principles:
- SRP: Each component has single responsibility
- OCP: Extensible via protocols and factory pattern
- LSP: All managers are substitutable via IStateManager
- ISP: Focused, minimal interfaces
- DIP: High-level modules depend on IStateManager abstraction

Usage:
    from victor.state import get_global_manager, StateScope

    # Get the global state manager
    state = get_global_manager()

    # Set a value
    await state.set("my_key", "value", scope=StateScope.WORKFLOW)

    # Get a value
    value = await state.get("my_key", scope=StateScope.WORKFLOW)

    # Create checkpoint
    checkpoint = await state.create_checkpoint()

    # Restore checkpoint
    await state.restore_checkpoint(checkpoint)
