"""Per-task execution manifest — the closed loop's joinable artifact.

Every benchmark run emits ``eval_manifest_<run_id>.jsonl`` (one record per
task) alongside the lean results JSON. Each record joins three things that
were previously disconnected:

1. **Outcome (reward)** — did the patch pass the task's tests? Ground-truth,
   no LLM judge.
2. **Trace** — the bounded execution trace (messages, tool calls, edits) the
   adapter captured, now persisted on ``TaskResult.trace``.
3. **Decisions** — every decision the agent logged during the task
   (``victor.agent.decisions.chain.log_decision``), filtered out of the
   global ``~/.victor/logs/decisions.jsonl`` by the per-task ``session_id``
   the adapter stamps on the correlation spine.

This single artifact is simultaneously the observability record (what did the
agent actually do — real ``code search``/``grep``/``graph`` usage), and the
classifier's training data (decisions labeled by outcome).
``victor.ml.mining`` projects it into ``training_rows.jsonl``.

Design notes
------------
- Decisions live in one global JSONL (cheap append, no per-run path
  management). We read it once and bucket by ``session_id``.
- The manifest is bounded: traces were already capped by the adapter (50
  messages / 100 tool calls / 20 edits); decisions are emitted as-is (they
  are small per-task).
- Emission is best-effort: a failure here must never break the benchmark.
