"""Rubric judge adapter for the calibration harness (EVR-2 × EVR-3, ADR-009 × ADR-011).

Wraps the ADR-009 rubric completion machinery
(:mod:`victor.framework.rubric_completion`) in the blinded
``(prompt, transcript, workspace) -> float`` interface of
:class:`~victor.evaluation.judge_calibration_harness.CalibrationJudge`, so the judge that
``completion_strategy=rubric`` would put in production is exactly the judge being calibrated.

Two constructors:

- :func:`make_rubric_judge` — wraps a (sync) :class:`RubricCompletionEvaluator`. Default-
  constructed it uses the deterministic ``HeuristicRubricJudge`` fallback, so the whole
  calibration runs with zero LLM calls. Calibrating this fallback is itself informative: it
  measures whether the no-LLM path the loop degrades to is trustworthy (expect: it is not —
  that is why ADR-011 gates the LLM judge instead of trusting the fallback blindly).
- :func:`make_llm_rubric_judge` — wraps :class:`AsyncRubricCompletionEvaluator` around an
  injected async ``complete_fn(prompt) -> text`` (a local Ollama model keeps it offline).
  Synchronous per the harness contract; owns its event loop via ``asyncio.run``.

What the rubric grades: the judge-visible view is rendered into a single content block
(task, tool activity, final response) via :func:`render_judged_content`. Verifier verdicts
never appear in it — blinding is inherited from the harness contract.

Score projection: by default the returned float is the **binary completion verdict**
(``1.0`` if the DimensionAwareFilter says COMPLETE) because that is the production decision
ADR-009 routes on — calibrate what you ship. ``score_mode="aggregate"`` returns the
confidence-weighted mean instead, for inspecting judge behavior below the decision boundary.

Known sharp edge worth watching in reports: when every dimension comes back at confidence
below the filter's floor (e.g. the LLM judge's error fallback scores everything at
confidence 0.2 < floor 0.25), no dimension is *engaged*, so the filter reports COMPLETE.
A judge whose provider is failing therefore looks systematically credulous — which the
α measurement will surface as poor agreement, and which is precisely why the gate exists.
