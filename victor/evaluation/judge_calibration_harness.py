"""Offline judge-calibration harness (EVR-2, ADR-011).

The :class:`~victor.evaluation.judge_calibration.JudgeReliabilityGate` needs a *gold* label
sequence to measure a judge against — but nothing requires those labels to come from human
annotators. This harness produces them from **programmatic verifiers**: each
:class:`VerifiableTask` materializes a fixture workspace, an executor (a real agent, a scripted
stand-in, or a replayed transcript) attempts the task, and the task's verifier computes the gold
completion label from the *actual workspace state* — the effect-grounded ground truth of ADR-010.

The judge is **blinded by construction**: it receives only the task prompt, the execution
transcript, and a read-only view of the workspace. Verifier verdicts are never part of its input,
so measured agreement is agreement, not leakage.

The whole loop runs offline — no LLM, no network — which makes it cheap enough to run in CI and
to smoke-test judge changes before spending tokens on SWE-bench-scale calibration.

Usage::

    from victor.evaluation.judge_calibration_harness import JudgeCalibrationHarness
    from victor.evaluation.calibration_corpus import default_corpus

    harness = JudgeCalibrationHarness(default_corpus(variants=8))
    report = harness.run(executor=my_executor, judge=my_judge)
    print(report.gate_decision)          # trusted / not trusted, with reason
    report.save(Path("calibration_report.json"))

Interpretation caveats (record them wherever a report is consumed):

- Gold labels are binary completion verdicts, so a passing gate trusts the judge **for
  completion decisions only** — it says nothing about the calibration of interval rubric scores.
- Agreement is reported per task family as well as overall; a judge may clear the gate on one
  distribution and fail on another. Graduate flags on the family you actually route through it.
