"""Timeout calculation strategies for agentic benchmark execution.

Provides configurable timeout policies that ensure sufficient time per turn
while respecting total task timeout constraints.

SOLID Compliance:
- OCP: New timeout policies can be added without modifying existing code
- SRP: Each policy has a single responsibility
- DIP: Policies depend on TimeoutPolicy protocol, not concrete implementations

Usage:
    from victor.evaluation.timeout_calculator import SafeTimeoutPolicy

    policy = SafeTimeoutPolicy()
    turn_timeout = policy.calculate(total_timeout=300, max_turns=10)
    # Returns max(30, 180) = 180 seconds
