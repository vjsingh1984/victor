"""Victor Agent Adapter for agentic benchmarks.

This module provides an adapter that connects Victor's AgentOrchestrator
to the AgenticBenchmarkRunner, enabling evaluation of Victor's agentic
capabilities on real-world coding tasks.

Features:
- Captures tool calls and file edits during execution
- Tracks multi-turn conversation metrics
- Generates patch diffs from file modifications
- Integrates with Victor's tool system

Usage:
    from victor.evaluation.agent_adapter import (
        VictorAgentAdapter,
        create_victor_agent_callback,
    )

    # Create adapter for a profile
    adapter = VictorAgentAdapter.from_profile("default", base_url="http://localhost:11434")

    # Use as callback for AgenticBenchmarkRunner
    callback = create_victor_agent_callback(adapter)
    result = await runner.run_task(task, callback, config)
