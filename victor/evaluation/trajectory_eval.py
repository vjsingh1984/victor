"""Trajectory-level evaluation harness (EVR-1, FEP-0008 Phase E).

Scores a *full* agent trajectory (not just its final answer) on orthogonal dimensions —
Planning, Tool-Grounding, Recovery, Refusal — and aggregates a battery of trajectories with
**confidence intervals** rather than point numbers (per arXiv:2605.10448; TRBench 2604.08178).

This module is the *measurement substrate* for the evaluation-centric runtime: it consumes the
existing :class:`~victor.evaluation.agentic_harness.AgenticExecutionTrace`, so no new instrumentation
is required. The default scorers here are **deterministic** (derived from the trace's structured
fields) — they introduce no LLM-judge dependency. Rubric / LLM-as-judge dimension scorers
(AdaRubric 2603.21362) plug into the same :class:`DimensionScorer` seam later, gated by the
judge-reliability harness (EVR-2 / ADR-011).

Each :class:`DimensionScore` carries a ``confidence`` in [0, 1] that is low when a turn/trajectory
does not engage that dimension (e.g. Refusal on a benign task), so the confidence-weighted aggregate
does not let an un-engaged dimension drag the score — and a future DimensionAwareFilter (ADR-009)
can gate only on *engaged* dimensions.
