"""Team coordination protocols (re-export from canonical location).

This module re-exports team protocols from victor.protocols.team for backward
compatibility. The canonical location is victor.protocols.team which breaks
circular dependencies between victor.teams and victor.framework.

Protocols:
    IAgent: Base agent protocol
    ITeamMember: Team member protocol
    ITeamCoordinator: Base coordinator protocol
    IObservableCoordinator: Observability capabilities
    IRLCoordinator: RL integration capabilities
    IMessageBusProvider: Message bus provider
    ISharedMemoryProvider: Shared memory provider
    IEnhancedTeamCoordinator: Combined capabilities

Import from here for backward compatibility, or import from victor.protocols.team
directly to break circular dependencies.
