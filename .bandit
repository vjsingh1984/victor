[skips]
# B101: assert_used
# We use assert statements in test files and some validation code
# This is acceptable because:
# 1. Test files are not production code
# 2. Python's -O flag optimizes out asserts
# B101

# B324: hashlib.md5
# MD5 is used for non-security purposes (caching, deduplication, identifiers)
# This is acceptable because:
# 1. Not used for cryptographic security
# 2. Used for deterministic hashing of code/content for caching
# 3. Used for deduplication and duplicate detection
# 4. Used for generating short identifiers from strings
# To fix: Add usedforsecurity=False parameter where appropriate
# Example: hashlib.md5(data.encode(), usedforsecurity=False)
# B324

# B602: subprocess_popen_with_shell_equals_true
# shell=True is used intentionally in subprocess_executor.py for flexibility
# This is acceptable because:
# 1. The tool is explicitly designed to execute shell commands
# 2. Input is controlled by the AI agent (not external users)
# 3. Warning messages are shown to users
# B602

# B701: jinja2_autoescape_false
# Jinja2 is used without autoescape in scaffold.py for code generation
# This is acceptable because:
# 1. Not rendering user-provided content
# 2. Generating code templates that are saved to files (not displayed in browser)
# To fix: Add autoescape=True or select_autoescape()
# B701
