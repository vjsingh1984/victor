# Victor AI Demo Prompts - Copy/Paste Ready
# ==========================================

# ============ SIMPLE PROMPTS ============

# Simple 1 - File listing (any provider)
List all Python files in this project and give me a one-line description of each

# Simple 2 - Quick question
What does this project do? Give me a brief overview.

# Simple 3 - Find a file
Find where the database models are defined

# ============ MEDIUM PROMPTS ============

# Medium 1 - Code analysis
Analyze the database_schema.py file. What design improvements would you recommend for better data integrity and query performance?

# Medium 2 - Architecture review
How does the protocols/ directory implement SOLID principles? Show me the interface definitions and explain the pattern.

# Medium 3 - Dependency analysis
What external APIs does this project integrate with? List them with their purpose.

# ============ COMPLEX PROMPTS ============

# Complex 1 - Test generation (Plan mode recommended)
Create a comprehensive pytest test suite for the WebSearchClient class in utils/web_search_client.py. Include tests for:
- Initialization and configuration
- Google Custom Search API calls (success and error cases)
- News API integration
- Database operations
- Edge cases and error handling
Use proper mocking with unittest.mock.patch for all external dependencies.

# Complex 2 - Feature planning (Plan mode)
I want to add a new data provider for Yahoo Finance that follows the existing protocol patterns. Create a detailed implementation plan including:
1. Interface compliance with IDataProvider
2. Rate limiting strategy
3. Error handling approach
4. Integration with existing NewsModel

# Complex 3 - Refactoring (Build mode)
Refactor the web_search_client.py to use async/await for all HTTP calls. Maintain backward compatibility with sync callers by adding wrapper methods.

# ============ MODE-SPECIFIC DEMOS ============

# Explore Mode - Research question
What are the main components of this codebase and how do they interact? Create a dependency diagram.

# Plan Mode - Architecture decision
Design a caching layer for API responses that supports both Redis and in-memory backends with a unified interface.

# Build Mode - Implementation
Add a retry decorator with exponential backoff to the web_search_client.py file. It should:
- Retry up to 3 times
- Use exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Log retry attempts
- Re-raise the final exception if all retries fail
