"""EVR-3 effectiveness comparison: LLM rubric judge vs the heuristic baseline.

Runs both completion judges over a small human-labeled set and reports which agrees better with the
ground-truth completion label — accuracy + Cohen's κ (EVR-2). This measures the crux: *does the
task-adaptive LLM rubric judge make better completion decisions than the deterministic baseline?*

The buffered `EnhancedCompletionEvaluator` is deeply coupled to `_evaluate`, so this A/B compares the
two *rubric* judges (the part that differs); a full end-to-end turn-count comparison needs the
strategy plumbed through chat construction (a follow-up).

Usage:
    python scripts/experiments/rubric_judge_eval.py            # heuristic baseline only (offline)
    python scripts/experiments/rubric_judge_eval.py --live     # also run the LLM judge via z.ai
