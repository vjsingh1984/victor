"""Shared multi-turn coding task battery for the A/B harnesses (completion + temperature).

Single-turn QA answers in one turn with no tools, so it can't differentiate completion strategies or
temperatures (every run ties at 1 turn). These tasks instead force the agent to USE TOOLS
(search/grep/read) across several turns against the real Victor repo, then synthesize — exercising the
turn-count / restatement / determinism deltas the A/Bs need:

- a strategy that over-/under-scores completion shows up as extra (restatement) turns;
- a temperature that makes tool-calling flakier shows up as higher turn variance.

All tasks are READ-ONLY (safe to run repeatedly) and answerable from the codebase, with a clear
completion point (the agent should stop once it has read the relevant code).
