"""Select unit-test targets for a set of changed files (fast develop gate).

Maps each changed file to the unit tests worth running on a develop PR, leveraging the repo's
mirrored layout (``tests/unit`` mirrors ``victor``):

- A changed **test** file (``tests/unit/**/test_*.py``) -> run it directly.
- A changed **source** file (``victor/<rel>/<name>.py``) -> run its mirror tests
  ``tests/unit/<rel>/test_<name>.py`` and ``tests/unit/<rel>/test_<name>_*.py`` (when they exist).

Prints existing pytest targets (one per line, deduped, sorted). Empty output means "nothing
relevant to run" — the caller should treat that as a pass (the full sharded suite at
develop->main is the safety net). This keeps the per-PR gate proportional to the change instead
of running the ~7h single-process suite.

Usage: ``select_changed_tests.py <changed_file> [<changed_file> ...]``
