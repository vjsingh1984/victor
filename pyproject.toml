# =============================================================================
# External Vertical Registration (for third-party packages)
# =============================================================================
# Third-party packages can register custom verticals with Victor by defining
# an entry point in the "victor.verticals" group.
#
# Example in external package's pyproject.toml:
#
#   [project.entry-points."victor.verticals"]
#   security = "victor_security:SecurityAssistant"
#   ml_ops = "victor_mlops.vertical:MLOpsAssistant"
#
# Requirements for external verticals:
#   1. Must inherit from victor.core.verticals.VerticalBase
#   2. Must define a non-empty 'name' class attribute
#   3. Must implement get_tools() -> List[str]
#   4. Must implement get_system_prompt() -> str
#
# Example vertical implementation:
#
#   from victor.core.verticals import VerticalBase
#
#   class SecurityAssistant(VerticalBase):
#       name = "security"
#       description = "Security vulnerability analysis assistant"
#
#       @classmethod
#       def get_tools(cls):
#           return ["read", "grep", "security_scan", "dependency_audit"]
#
#       @classmethod
#       def get_system_prompt(cls):
#           return "You are a security expert..."
#
# Victor will automatically discover and register external verticals on import.
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# Dynamic Capability Registration (Open/Closed Principle)
# =============================================================================
# Third-party packages can register custom capabilities with Victor by defining
# an entry point in the "victor.capabilities" group.
#
# Example in external package's pyproject.toml:
#
#   [project.entry-points."victor.capabilities"]
#   my_capability = "my_package.capabilities:MyCapabilityClass"
#
# Requirements for external capabilities:
#   1. Must inherit from victor.agent.capabilities.base.CapabilityBase
#   2. Must implement get_spec() classmethod returning CapabilitySpec
#
# Example capability implementation:
#
#   from victor.agent.capabilities.base import CapabilityBase, CapabilitySpec
#
#   class MyCapabilityClass(CapabilityBase):
#       @classmethod
#       def get_spec(cls) -> CapabilitySpec:
#           return CapabilitySpec(
#               name="my_capability",
