# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records for the Victor AI Framework.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document significant architectural decisions made during the development of Victor. Each ADR captures:

- **Context**: The problem or situation
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Rationale**: Why the decision was made
- **Consequences**: Positive, negative, and neutral impacts

ADRs record *decisions*; the [Technical Debt Register](../../tech-stack.md#technical-debt-register)
records *work*. When an ADR's rollout is incomplete, the remaining work must have a TD-* or EVR-*
entry — the ADR itself never tracks tasks.

## ADR Index

Status is the governance state of the *decision*. Implementation is the observed state of the
*code* (verified 2026-07-02).

## External ADR series (cross-repo)

Victor's code-memory direction is co-designed with two sibling repositories that keep their own ADR
series. References like "ADR-029" or "ADR-044" in commits, code comments, and `victor-codegraph/`
belong to those series — they are **not** missing Victor ADRs.

| Series | Repo / path | Numbering style | Referenced decisions |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| ProximaDB | `proximaDB/docs/12-design/adr/` | `ADR-0NN` (2-digit, high numbers) | **ADR-029** shared codegraph chunker package (authoritative for the cross-repo chunker decision; pairs with Victor ADR-014/015) · **ADR-044** stable, line-independent symbol oid — the correlated-CPG join key (implemented in `victor-codegraph` 0.1.2) · ADR-028 index policy routing (unrelated to the chunker) |
| AnvaiOps | `anvaiops/docs/adr/` | `NNNN` (4-digit) | **0017** code-graph-as-a-service · **0018** consume shared codegraph chunker (SaaS consumer of `victor-codegraph`) |

Rules for cross-repo decisions:

1. One repo is named **authoritative** for each shared decision; the others hold thin consumer ADRs
   that link to it (chunker: ProximaDB ADR-029 authoritative, Victor ADR-014 owner-of-record for the
   package, AnvaiOps 0018 consumer).
2. Victor code and docs must cite external ADRs with their series name (e.g. "ProximaDB ADR-044"),
   never a bare number.
3. When an external ADR materially changes Victor behavior (as ADR-044 did for symbol identity),
   add or amend a Victor ADR that records the local consequence.

### ADR-016: Distribution & Packaging Strategy

**Decision**: Ship victor as a Docker image (`full` with all extras, `slim` core-only) as the primary packaged artifact; retain the pip-installable package for dev/extensible use; reject native single-binary (PyInstaller/Nuitka/PyOxidizer) as primary.

**Key Points**:
- Hosts run full-capability victor with only Docker — no dep provisioning, no venv pollution, no version drift.
- One consistent container story: `victor:full` agent + per-task eval images (correct runtime per task).
- Native single-binary rejected because victor's architecture fights freezing: dynamic plugin/entry-point discovery, optional native Rust extensions, heavy ML deps (torch ~2 GB), and the pip-based extensibility model.
- Dev experience unchanged (editable pip install remains first-class).

## Creating New ADRs

When making a significant architectural decision:

1. Copy the [template](000-template.md)
2. Fill in all sections
3. Use the next sequential number (next free: **ADR-016**)
4. Update this index (both tables if cross-repo)
5. Submit for review

Heading convention: `# ADR-0NN: Title` (hyphenated) with a `## Metadata` list — ADRs 006/007/008/014/015
predate this and drift cosmetically; new ADRs must follow it.

## ADR Lifecycle

```
Proposed → Accepted → Superseded/Deprecated
```

- **Proposed**: Initial draft for discussion
- **Accepted**: Decision made (implementation may still be phased/opt-in — record that in the
  Implementation column above, and file remaining rollout work as TD-*/EVR-* items)
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision (link to the new ADR from the old one)
- **Deprecated**: No longer applicable

Advance the status when reality changes: an ADR that shipped weeks ago must not still read
"Proposed" (this index and the file metadata must agree — the file is authoritative on conflict).
