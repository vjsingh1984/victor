# ADR-018: Adopt the `sandhi` OSS usage gateway (own repo, not a Victor module)

## Metadata

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Date**: 2026-07-18
- **Decision Makers**: Vijaykumar Singh
- **Related ADRs**: ADR-014/ADR-015 (shared `victor-codegraph` cross-repo pattern);
  AnvaiOps **ADR-0047** (authoritative open-core split); ProximaDB **ADR-067**
  (sibling consumer)
- **Related FEP**: FEP-0020 (public feature spec + framework seams)

## Context

Victor tracks token/USD cost per session (`victor/agent/session_cost_tracker.py`)
but has **no per-user/per-team attribution and no gateway** in front of a shared
provider key (see FEP-0020 for the full gap analysis). The capability is wanted
across three repos — Victor, ProximaDB (Rust), AnvaiOps (commercial) — each with
its own provider layer in a different language. A shared in-process library cannot
span them; the cross-language unifier is a reverse-proxy + a neutral usage-event
schema.

The homing question — own project, or folded into Victor / ProximaDB / AnvaiOps —
is decided authoritatively in **AnvaiOps ADR-0047**. This ADR records Victor's
**local consequence**: which repo owns the code, and which side of the open-core
line Victor stays on. (Per the cross-repo rules in this directory's README: one
repo is authoritative for a shared decision; the others hold thin consumer ADRs
that link to it. AnvaiOps ADR-0047 is authoritative; this is Victor's consumer ADR;
Victor is owner-of-record for the public feature spec, FEP-0020.)

## Decision

**Adopt a standalone Apache-2.0 OSS repo `sandhi` (`anvai-labs/sandhi`) as an external
dependency** — not a `victor/` internal package. Victor consumes it two ways: an
in-process metering middleware over `BaseProvider`, and an optional reverse-proxy
serve mode with virtual keys for shared-key teams (FEP-0020 § Proposed Change).

Victor stays entirely on the **OSS side** of the open-core line (AnvaiOps
ADR-0047 D4): virtual keys, per-user/per-team attribution, budgets/rate-limits,
local cost display, and a self-hosted dashboard are all OSS. Authoritative
multi-tenant billing, tier→$ policy, SSO/RBAC governance, and managed dashboards
at scale are AnvaiOps's commercial layer — Victor does not build them.

The dependency direction is one-way (`victor → sandhi`), and `sandhi` is pinned like
the `victor-codegraph` / `proximadb` optional extras. It ships **default-off**;
enabling it is opt-in with zero behavior change by default (FEP-0020 § Migration).

## Rationale

- **Why its own repo, not folded into Victor?** A Python-internal home cannot be
  consumed in-process by ProximaDB (Rust) or third parties; the language-agnostic
  proxy must live where every consumer is first-class. This mirrors why the
  code→CPG chunker became the standalone `victor-codegraph` rather than staying in
  `victor-coding`.
- **Why OSS (Apache-2.0)?** Matches Victor + ProximaDB; per-user attribution is
  the adoption lever (LiteLLM/Helicone ship it OSS). Gating it would put Victor
  *behind* the incumbents on the exact feature that drives adoption. The
  commercial moat is billing + governance + managed scale, which AnvaiOps holds.
- **Why a thin consumer ADR here?** The homing/business decision is AnvaiOps's
  (it owns the commercial split); Victor records only the local consequence
  (dependency + boundary posture), per this directory's cross-repo rule 3.
- **Pro:** closes the attribution gap; one neutral event feeds both Victor's
  dashboard and AnvaiOps billing; no new provider plumbing (middleware wraps the
  existing `usage` dict). **Con:** a new external dependency and a cross-repo wire
  contract to keep stable.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Victor can answer "who spent what" across a shared key, budget
  per user, and rate-limit runaway subjects — matching the OSS incumbents while
  the code stays reusable by ProximaDB and AnvaiOps through one schema.
- **Negative**: a fourth repo in the ecosystem; the neutral usage-event schema is
  now a cross-repo API whose breaking changes must coordinate (same discipline as
  `victor-codegraph`). Building the proxy ahead of real shared-key demand would be
  premature — hence code is out of scope (docs only); the proxy ships when demand
  is real.
- **Neutral**: default-off; attribution fields default to `None`, so no migration
  and no change for users who don't opt in. The remaining rollout work is tracked
  as a TD in the Technical Debt Register, not in this ADR.

## Implementation

Out of scope for this ADR (decision doc only, per AnvaiOps ADR-0047). The framework
seams and phased plan live in FEP-0020; the remaining wiring is a TD row in
`docs/tech-stack.md` (join `client_id`/`subject`→cost; proxy serve-mode hardening).

## Alternatives Considered

- **Fold the gateway into `victor/`.** Rejected: cannot serve ProximaDB/third
  parties over the proxy (AnvaiOps ADR-0047 D1).
- **Extend `SessionCostTracker` with attribution, no proxy.** Rejected: covers
  same-process Victor only, not shared-key/internal-network teams (FEP-0020 Alt 2).
- **Depend on an external gateway (LiteLLM/Portkey) directly instead of `sandhi`.**
  Rejected as the *primary* path: those are the reuse targets *inside* `sandhi`
  (AnvaiOps ADR-0020 D2), but Victor needs the neutral event + code-graph-aligned
  attribution the shared schema provides; `sandhi` is the thin owner of that seam.
  (`sandhi` may wrap a LiteLLM-shaped router internally.)
