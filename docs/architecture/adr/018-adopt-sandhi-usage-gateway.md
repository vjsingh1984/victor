# ADR-018: Adopt the `sandhi` OSS usage gateway (own repo, not a Victor module)

## Metadata

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-07-18
- **Decision Makers**: Vijaykumar Singh
- **Related ADRs**: ADR-014/ADR-015 (shared `victor-codegraph` cross-repo pattern);
  AnvaiOps **ADR-0047** (authoritative open-core split); ProximaDB **ADR-067**
  (sibling consumer)
- **Related FEP**: FEP-0020 (public feature spec + framework seams)

## Context

Victor tracks token/USD cost per session (`victor/agent/session_cost_tracker.py`)
but has **no per-user/per-team attribution and no gateway** in front of a shared
provider key (see FEP-0020 for the full gap analysis). The capability is wanted
across three repos — Victor, ProximaDB (Rust), AnvaiOps (commercial) — each with
its own provider layer in a different language. A shared in-process library cannot
span them; the cross-language unifier is a reverse-proxy + a neutral usage-event
schema.

The homing question — own project, or folded into Victor / ProximaDB / AnvaiOps —
is decided authoritatively in **AnvaiOps ADR-0047**. This ADR records Victor's
**local consequence**: which repo owns the code, and which side of the open-core
line Victor stays on. (Per the cross-repo rules in this directory's README: one
repo is authoritative for a shared decision; the others hold thin consumer ADRs
that link to it. AnvaiOps ADR-0047 is authoritative; this is Victor's consumer ADR;
Victor is owner-of-record for the public feature spec, FEP-0020.)

## Decision

**Adopt a standalone Apache-2.0 OSS repo `sandhi` (`anvai-labs/sandhi`) as an external
dependency** — not a `victor/` internal package. Victor consumes it two ways: an
in-process metering middleware over `BaseProvider`, and an optional reverse-proxy
serve mode with virtual keys for shared-key teams (FEP-0020 § Proposed Change).

Victor stays entirely on the **OSS side** of the open-core line (AnvaiOps
ADR-0047 D4): virtual keys, per-user/per-team attribution, budgets/rate-limits,
local cost display, and a self-hosted dashboard are all OSS. Authoritative
multi-tenant billing, tier→$ policy, SSO/RBAC governance, and managed dashboards
at scale are AnvaiOps's commercial layer — Victor does not build them.

The dependency direction is one-way (`victor → sandhi`). The typed provider runtime is a
required Victor dependency; the separately configured attribution gateway/proxy remains
default-off (FEP-0020 § Migration). Sandhi 0.1.1 is the last published version; the complete
typed-runtime migration ships once as 0.1.2 because there are no external compatibility users.

For provider transport, the ownership boundary is explicit: Victor owns agent/model
policy and normalized framework objects; Sandhi owns endpoint routing, headers, HTTP/SSE,
wire errors, resilience, and neutral usage extraction. The active transport is the sole
retry/timeout/circuit owner. Sandhi's catalog contains stable wire facts only, while Victor
retains volatile model metadata and capability/discovery policy. An admitted provider has one
Sandhi execution path with no replay, demotion, or native Python wire fallback.

For OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions, Victor owns normalized history and provider/model
capability policy while Sandhi owns the stable wire-role contract. Both preserve
`developer`, `system`, `user`, `assistant`, `tool`, and legacy `function`; Sandhi rejects
unknown roles and missing `tool_call_id`/legacy function `name` before HTTP. Neither layer
silently rewrites `developer` to `system`, because that is model-specific policy.

OpenAI Responses is a separate Sandhi endpoint family, not a Chat Completions alias. API-key
Responses uses the public `/v1/responses` profile. ChatGPT subscription OAuth explicitly selects
the Codex profile at `/backend-api/codex/responses`; Victor acquires and refreshes the credential
and optional workspace account id, while Sandhi enforces the profile's item-array input,
instructions, `store=false`, SSE-only upstream behavior, stream aggregation, and Responses token
metering. Token text and URL shape are never used to guess the protocol.

## Rationale

- **Why its own repo, not folded into Victor?** A Python-internal home cannot be
  consumed in-process by ProximaDB (Rust) or third parties; the language-agnostic
  proxy must live where every consumer is first-class. This mirrors why the
  code→CPG chunker became the standalone `victor-codegraph` rather than staying in
  `victor-coding`.
- **Why OSS (Apache-2.0)?** Matches Victor + ProximaDB; per-user attribution is
  the adoption lever (LiteLLM/Helicone ship it OSS). Gating it would put Victor
  *behind* the incumbents on the exact feature that drives adoption. The
  commercial moat is billing + governance + managed scale, which AnvaiOps holds.
- **Why a thin consumer ADR here?** The homing/business decision is AnvaiOps's
  (it owns the commercial split); Victor records only the local consequence
  (dependency + boundary posture), per this directory's cross-repo rule 3.
- **Pro:** closes the attribution gap; one neutral event feeds both Victor's
  dashboard and AnvaiOps billing; provider wire plumbing converges in Sandhi instead
  of multiplying in each consumer. **Con:** a new external dependency and a cross-repo wire
  contract to keep stable.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Victor can answer "who spent what" across a shared key, budget
  per user, and rate-limit runaway subjects — matching the OSS incumbents while
  the code stays reusable by ProximaDB and AnvaiOps through one schema.
- **Negative**: a fourth repo in the ecosystem; the neutral usage-event schema is
  now a cross-repo API whose breaking changes must coordinate (same discipline as
  `victor-codegraph`). Building the proxy ahead of real shared-key demand would be
  premature — hence code is out of scope (docs only); the proxy ships when demand
  is real.
- **Neutral**: default-off; attribution fields default to `None`, so no migration
  and no change for users who don't opt in. The remaining rollout work is tracked
  as a TD in the Technical Debt Register, not in this ADR.

## Implementation

The framework seams and migration ledger live in FEP-0020 and Sandhi TD-0002. Attribution,
middleware, proxy serve mode, shared usage parsing, and the direct typed runtime have landed.
The admitted OpenAI-compatible cloud providers are thin Victor model/orchestration policies;
their endpoint routing, HTTP/SSE, errors, resilience, roles/tools, and usage parsing execute in
Sandhi. Groq payload budgeting and Cerebras inline-reasoning presentation remain in Victor because
they are agent/UX policy, not provider transport.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Fold the gateway into `victor/`.** Rejected: cannot serve ProximaDB/third
  parties over the proxy (AnvaiOps ADR-0047 D1).
- **Extend `SessionCostTracker` with attribution, no proxy.** Rejected: covers
  same-process Victor only, not shared-key/internal-network teams (FEP-0020 Alt 2).
- **Depend on an external gateway (LiteLLM/Portkey) directly instead of `sandhi`.**
  Rejected as the *primary* path: those are the reuse targets *inside* `sandhi`
  (AnvaiOps ADR-0020 D2), but Victor needs the neutral event + code-graph-aligned
  attribution the shared schema provides; `sandhi` is the thin owner of that seam.
  (`sandhi` may wrap a LiteLLM-shaped router internally.)
