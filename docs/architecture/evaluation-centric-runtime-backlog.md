# Evaluation-Centric Runtime — Backlog & Spec

**Status:** Draft · **Created:** 2026-06-21 · **Companion:**

Prioritized backlog for the Evaluation-Centric Runtime direction, derived from an arXiv corpus
survey grounded against Victor's eval/loop code. **Thesis:** *Agent = Model + Harness* — close the
evaluation loop and gate every change on it. Tags: `feature` / `techdebt` / `vision`. Effort:
S/M/L. This **integrates** the prior `../arxive` roadmap (see "Integration" below); the internal
`docs/roadmap.md` carries the same epic for local planning.

## Sequencing (measurement-first)

`EVR-1 → EVR-2 → (EVR-4 ∥ EVR-3) → EVR-5 → EVR-6 → EVR-7 → …`

EVR-3 must **match-or-beat** `EnhancedCompletionEvaluator` on the parity + characterization batteries
before becoming the default `completion_strategy`.

## Integration with the prior roadmap

From `../arxive/agentic_runtime_roadmap_2026-04-27.md` (standing P0s), reconciled — not replaced:

- **Cost-aware topology routing** and the **generative-optimization benchmark harness** become
  *consumers* of the EVR-5 acceptance oracle (they are graded by it).
- **Experiment / proactive memory** is fed by EVR-7 (segment-level process reward → learners).
- **Calibrated uncertainty** (truth-aligned `2604.00445`) is the substrate for EVR-2 / EVR-11.

## Already delivered — do not re-propose

Perception + calibrated-confidence fusion, the PPAED loop (FEP-0007 unified), GEPA / MIPROv2 / CoT
distillation, FulfillmentDetector, semantic response cache, paradigm routing, tool-loop/spin
detection, offline `AgenticExecutionTrace`.

**Meta-deliberation narration guard.** `_is_intent_only_response` (in both
`victor/framework/agentic_loop.py` and `victor/framework/enhanced_completion_evaluation.py`)
now performs a full-response density check in addition to the legacy first-line prefix
check. When a response carries no payload (no fenced code block, no markdown table) and
contains 3+ distinct imminent-action markers ("Executing now", "Going now", "Calling now",
"Making the call", "no more deliberation"), it is classified as intent-only narration rather
than a substantial answer. This prevents the failure mode where the model narrates imminent
action without ever invoking a tool, which previously exited the loop before any tool ran.
Real answers carrying a code block or result table are never flagged.
