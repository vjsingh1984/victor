## What are Dynamic Skills?

Dynamic skills extend Victor's tool system with:

### Skill Discovery
- **Runtime tool discovery**: Find available tools dynamically
- **MCP tool integration**: Discover tools from MCP servers
- **Semantic matching**: Match tools to tasks using similarity
- **Tool compatibility analysis**: Check if tools work well together

### Skill Composition
- **Multi-tool skills**: Combine multiple tools into cohesive skills
- **Skill patterns**: Reusable skill templates
- **Dynamic registration**: Register new skills at runtime
- **Skill metadata**: Rich descriptions and capabilities

### Skill Chaining
- **Automatic planning**: Plan multi-step workflows
- **Dependency management**: Handle tool dependencies
- **Parallel execution**: Execute independent skills in parallel
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure recovery

### When to Use Dynamic Skills

**Ideal for:**
- Uncertain which tools to use for a task
- Need to combine multiple tools
- Dynamic workflow composition
- MCP tool integration
- Adaptive agent behavior

**Not ideal for:**
- Simple, single-tool tasks
