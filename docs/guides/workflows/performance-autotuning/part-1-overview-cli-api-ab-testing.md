## Overview

The PerformanceAutotuner system automatically analyzes team execution metrics and suggests optimizations to improve performance, reduce costs, and increase reliability.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Analysis**: Analyzes historical metrics to identify bottlenecks
- **Intelligent Suggestions**: Recommends optimizations based on patterns and benchmarks
- **A/B Testing**: Validates optimizations before permanent application
- **Rollback Safety**: Automatically reverts optimizations on regression detection
- **Multi-Strategy**: Supports 6 optimization strategies (team sizing, formation, budget, etc.)

### Expected Improvements

Based on benchmark data, auto-tuning typically provides:

| Optimization Type | Avg Improvement | Risk Level |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Formation Selection | 20-50% | Medium |
| Team Sizing | 10-20% | Low |
| Tool Budget | 5-15% | Low |
| Timeout Tuning | 5-10% | Very Low |

**Overall Target**: 10-20% performance improvement through automated optimization.
