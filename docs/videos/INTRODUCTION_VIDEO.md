## Script

### [0:00-1:00] Hook

**[Visual: Dynamic montage of coding screens, AI assistants, and developer workflows]**

**Narrator:** "What if you had an AI coding assistant that works with 21 different AI models, understands your entire codebase, and costs 90% less than alternatives?"

**[Visual: Victor AI logo appears with tagline: "Your Universal AI Coding Assistant"]**

**Narrator:** "Introducing Victor AI - the open-source AI coding assistant that gives you complete control over your AI-powered development workflow."

**[Visual: Screen recording showing Victor AI in action]**

**Narrator:** "Whether you're a solo developer, part of a startup team, or working in a large enterprise, Victor AI adapts to your needs, your preferences, and your budget."

### [1:00-2:00] Problem Statement

**[Visual: Developer looking frustrated at multiple AI tools]**

**Narrator:** "Let's face it - modern AI coding assistants have limitations. They lock you into one provider, drain your wallet with expensive API calls, and struggle to understand the full context of your codebase."

**[Visual: Split screen showing multiple AI tools with different pricing]**

**Narrator:** "You might be paying hundreds of dollars per month for AI assistance that doesn't even work with your favorite models or understand your project's specific needs."

**[Visual: Chart showing rising AI tool costs]**

**Narrator:** "And when you need to switch between different AI providers for different tasks, it becomes a workflow nightmare. That's where Victor AI changes everything."

### [2:00-3:00] Solution Overview

**[Visual: Victor AI architecture diagram]**

**Narrator:** "Victor AI is a free, open-source AI coding assistant that gives you unprecedented flexibility. Built with a vertical architecture, Victor provides specialized tools across five key domains: coding, DevOps, RAG, data analysis, and research."

**[Visual: Five vertical icons appearing]**

**Narrator:** "But what truly sets Victor apart is its provider-agnostic design. With support for 21 different LLM providers, from local free options like Ollama to premium models like Claude and GPT-4, you're always in control."

**[Visual: Provider logos spinning in a carousel]**

**Narrator:** "Victor's intelligent workflow system lets you automate complex tasks, while its semantic codebase search ensures the AI truly understands your code."

### [3:00-7:00] Key Features Demo

#### [3:00-4:00] Feature 1: Code Analysis

**[Visual: Terminal showing Victor AI chat]**

**Narrator:** "Let's see Victor in action. I'll start by asking it to analyze a codebase for security vulnerabilities."

**[Visual: Typing command]**
```
victor chat "Analyze src/ for security vulnerabilities focusing on SQL injection and XSS"
```

**[Visual: Victor's response appearing in real-time]**

**Narrator:** "Watch how Victor identifies potential vulnerabilities, explains the risks, and provides specific code fixes. It understands the context of your entire codebase, not just individual files."

**[Visual: Code comparison showing vulnerability and fix]**

**Narrator:** "This comprehensive analysis would take hours manually, but Victor delivers it in seconds."

#### [4:00-5:00] Feature 2: Multi-Provider Strategy

**[Visual: Configuration file showing multiple providers]**

**Narrator:** "Here's where Victor really shines - cost optimization. I can strategically use different providers for different tasks."

**[Visual: Terminal showing provider switches]**

**Narrator:** "I'll brainstorm using the free local Ollama model, implement with cost-effective GPT-3.5, then review with premium Claude."

**[Visual: Cost comparison chart]**

**Narrator:** "This multi-provider approach reduces costs by 90% while maintaining quality where it matters most."

#### [5:00-6:00] Feature 3: Workflow Automation

**[Visual: Workflow YAML file]**

**Narrator:** "Victor's workflow system automates complex multi-step processes. This YAML workflow defines a complete code review process."

**[Visual: Workflow execution visualization]**

**Narrator:** "With a single command, Victor performs security scanning, quality analysis, performance review, and generates a comprehensive report."

**[Visual: Generated report document]**

**Narrator:** "Workflows ensure consistency and save hours of repetitive work."

#### [6:00-7:00] Feature 4: Semantic Search

**[Visual: Code search interface]**

**Narrator:** "Victor's semantic search understands the meaning of your code, not just keywords. Ask 'find all database queries' and it locates them regardless of naming conventions."

**[Visual: Search results showing relevant code]**

**Narrator:** "This contextual understanding makes Victor incredibly powerful for navigating large codebases."

### [7:00-8:30] Provider Flexibility

**[Visual: Provider grid showing all 21 options]**

**Narrator:** "With 21 provider options, Victor works with any model you prefer:

**[Visual: Groups of providers appearing]**

**Narrator:** "Local free options: Ollama, LMStudio, vLLM - perfect for development and testing."

**Narrator:** "Cost-effective cloud: OpenAI GPT-3.5, Google Gemini, Grok - great for implementation."

**Narrator:** "Premium models: Claude, GPT-4 - ideal for critical reviews and complex reasoning."

**[Visual: Provider switching demo]**

**Narrator:** "Switch between providers mid-conversation without losing context. Each provider brings its strengths, and Victor lets you leverage them all."
