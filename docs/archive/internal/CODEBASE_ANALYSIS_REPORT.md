# Codebase Analysis Report

Short summary of the latest codebase analysis.

## Highlights
- Core systems are stable; complexity is concentrated in the orchestrator and tooling layers.
- Embeddings and workflows are functional but still evolving.
- Provider behavior varies across models; results depend on configuration and hardware.

## Next Steps
- Keep simplifying public docs and examples.
- Reduce cross‑module coupling in core execution paths.
- Add small, targeted tests around tool execution and provider adapters.
