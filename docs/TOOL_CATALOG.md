# Tool Catalog (auto-generated)

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `analyze_docs` | Analyze documentation coverage and quality. Checks documentation coverage (percentage of functions/classes with docstrings) and optionally analyzes documentation quality. |
| `analyze_metrics` | Comprehensive code metrics and quality analysis. Analyzes code quality metrics including complexity, maintainability, technical debt, and code structure. Consolidates multiple metric types into a single unified interface. |
| `apply_patch` | Apply a unified diff patch to one or more files. Parses and applies unified diff format patches to files. Supports creating new files, deleting files, and modifying existing files. Includes fuzzy matching for context lines to handle minor differences. Args: patch: The unified diff patch content to apply. file_path: Optional specific file path (overrides paths in diff). dry_run: If True, show what would be changed without applying (default: False). fuzz: Lines of context that can be different when matching (default: 2). backup: If True, create backup of modified files (default: True). Returns: Dictionary containing: - success: Whether all patches were applied successfully - files_modified: List of files that were modified - files_created: List of files that were created - files_deleted: List of files that were deleted - warnings: List of warning messages - preview: Preview of changes (if dry_run=True) Examples: Apply a simple patch: apply_patch(patch=''' --- a/hello.py +++ b/hello.py |
| `batch` | Unified batch processing tool for multi-file operations. Performs parallel batch operations on multiple files including search, replace, analyze, and list operations. Consolidates all batch processing functionality into a single interface. |

| `code_search` | Simple keyword-based code search for exact text matches. Use this ONLY for simple, literal keyword searches (e.g., "def foo", "import xyz"). For conceptual queries like "find classes that inherit", "find error handling", or "find all implementations of X", use semantic_code_search instead. Scans files and scores by keyword match frequency. Fast but misses semantic meaning. |
| `create_patch` | Create a unified diff patch from a file and new content. Generates a unified diff patch that can be applied later or reviewed. Useful for showing changes before applying them. |
| `database` | Unified database tool for SQL operations. Supports SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server.

| `dependency` | Unified dependency management tool for Python projects. Actions: - list: List all installed packages - outdated: Check for outdated packages - security: Scan for security vulnerabilities - generate: Generate requirements.txt file (uses output param) - update: Update packages (requires packages, uses dry_run) - tree: Show dependency tree (optional package param) - check: Verify requirements file satisfaction (uses requirements_file) |
| `docker` | Unified Docker operations for container and image management. Provides a single interface for all Docker operations, mirroring the Docker CLI structure. Consolidates 15 separate Docker tools into one. |
| `edit_files` | Unified file editing with transaction support. Perform multiple file operations in a single transaction with built-in preview and rollback capability. OPERATION TYPES: - "replace" (RECOMMENDED for edits): Surgical string replacement. Only changes the exact matched text, preserving the rest of the file. Use this for fixing bugs, refactoring, or adding code to existing files. Requires: old_str (exact text to find), new_str (replacement text). FAILS if old_str not found or matches multiple times (ambiguous). - "create": Create a new file. Use for new files only. Requires: path, content. - "modify": Replace ENTIRE file content. Use only when you need to completely rewrite a file. For surgical edits, use "replace" instead. Requires: path, content (or new_content). - "delete": Remove a file. Requires: path. - "rename": Move/rename a file. Requires: path, new_path. |
