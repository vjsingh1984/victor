## What is a FEP?

A **Framework Enhancement Proposal (FEP)** is a design document providing information to the Victor community, or describing a new feature for the Victor framework or its ecosystem. FEPs provide technical specifications and the rationale behind feature design.

The FEP process is inspired by similar processes in other open-source projects like Python (PEPs), Rust (RFCs), and Ethereum (ERCs/EIPs).

### Goals of the FEP Process

- **Community-driven**: Enable community members to contribute to Victor's direction
- **Transparent**: Make design decisions and rationale visible to all
- **Structured**: Provide a clear, documented path for proposing changes
- **Quality-focused**: Ensure changes are well-thought-out and properly reviewed

---

## When to Create a FEP

Not every change requires a FEP. Use the following guidelines to determine when to create one.

### Requires a FEP

- **New framework-level features**: Core functionality affecting multiple components
- **Breaking changes**: API/protocol changes that break backward compatibility
- **Major architectural changes**: Structural changes to Victor's design
- **New vertical types**: Adding new vertical categories
- **Workflow system changes**: Modifications to the workflow DSL or execution engine
- **Tool protocol changes**: Changes to tool interfaces or calling conventions
- **Provider protocol changes**: Changes to LLM provider interfaces
- **Configuration schema changes**: New config sections or modified structures

### Does NOT Require a FEP

- **Bug fixes**: Patches to existing functionality
- **Documentation improvements**: Typos, clarifications, new guides
- **Test improvements**: Additional test coverage, test refactoring
- **Code refactoring**: Internal cleanup without API changes
- **Performance optimizations**: Speed improvements without API changes
- **New vertical implementations**: Creating a new vertical using existing patterns
- **New tools**: Adding tools that fit existing patterns
- **Minor feature additions**: Small enhancements within existing APIs

### When in Doubt

If you're unsure whether a change requires a FEP:

1. Open a GitHub Discussion to gauge community interest
2. Ask in the Victor Discord/Slack community
3. Create a draft FEP (marked as "Draft") to solicit feedback

---

## FEP Types

FEPs are categorized into three types:

### Standards Track

These describe changes that affect most or all implementations, such as:
- New framework features
- API changes
- Protocol modifications
- Major architectural changes

**Status flow**: Draft → Review → Accepted → Implemented (or Rejected)

### Informational

These describe design issues, general guidelines, or community decisions, but do not propose new features.

**Status flow**: Draft → Accepted (no implementation required)

### Process

These describe changes to the FEP process itself, or changes to the Victor project governance.

**Status flow**: Draft → Accepted → Implemented (or Rejected)

```

### Status Values

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | FEP is open for community feedback and refinement |
| **Review** | FEP is under active review (14-day minimum period) |
| **Accepted** | FEP is approved and implementation can begin |
| **Rejected** | FEP was not accepted (with documented rationale) |
| **Deferred** | FEP is postponed (can be revived later) |
| **Withdrawn** | Author withdrew the FEP |
| **Implemented** | FEP has been fully implemented and released |

---

## Submission Process

### 1. Pre-Submission Discussion (Optional but Recommended)

Before writing a full FEP:

- **Open a GitHub Discussion**: Present your idea and get initial feedback
- **Check for related FEPs**: Search existing FEPs to avoid duplication
- **Discuss with maintainers**: Get early feedback on feasibility and scope

### 2. Create the FEP

Use the `victor fep create` command:

```bash
victor fep create \
  --title "My Framework Enhancement" \
  --type standards \
  --author "Your Name" \
  --email "your.email@example.com"
```

This creates a new FEP file from the template with pre-filled metadata.

### 3. Write the FEP

Fill out all required sections of the FEP template:

- **Summary**: High-level overview (~200 words)
- **Motivation**: Why this change is needed
- **Proposed Change**: Detailed technical specification
- **Benefits**: What this improves
- **Drawbacks and Alternatives**: Honest assessment and alternatives considered
- **Implementation Plan**: Phased approach with timeline
- **Migration Path**: How to transition (if breaking)
- **Compatibility**: Backward compatibility analysis
- **Review Process**: Track review feedback
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear success criteria

### 4. Validate the FEP

Check your FEP for completeness:

```bash
victor fep validate fep-XXXX-my-enhancement.md
```

This checks:
- YAML frontmatter is valid
- All required sections are present
- Sections meet minimum word count guidelines
- Metadata is complete

### 5. Submit the FEP

Create a pull request with your FEP:

```bash
victor fep submit fep-XXXX-my-enhancement.md
```

Or manually:

1. Commit your FEP: `git commit -am "FEP-XXXX: My enhancement"`
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fep-XXXX-my-enhancement`
3. Push to GitHub: `git push -u origin fep-XXXX-my-enhancement`
4. Open a PR via GitHub web interface
5. Use the PR template for FEP submissions

### 6. FEP Number Assignment

The maintainers will assign a FEP number when they merge your PR. Update your filename and frontmatter:

- Rename: `fep-XXXX-my-enhancement.md` → `fep-0001-my-enhancement.md`
- Update frontmatter: `fep: XXXX` → `fep: 1`

### 7. Review Period

Once merged to the `feps` directory:

- **Minimum 14-day review period** begins
- FEP status is set to "Review"
- Community feedback is solicited via:
  - GitHub discussion thread
  - Announcement in Discord/Slack
  - Reviewers assigned

### 8. Address Feedback

- Respond to all review comments
- Update the FEP based on feedback
- Track revision history in the "Review Process" section

---

## Review Criteria

FEPs are evaluated based on the following criteria:

### Technical Excellence

- **Clarity**: Is the specification clear and unambiguous?
- **Completeness**: Does it cover all edge cases and error conditions?
- **API Design**: Does it follow Victor's conventions and best practices?
- **Feasibility**: Can this be implemented reasonably?

### Community Impact

- **Use Cases**: Are the use cases well-defined and compelling?
- **Benefits**: Do the benefits outweigh the costs/complexity?
- **Adoption**: Is the community likely to adopt this?
- **Compatibility**: What is the impact on existing code/verticals?

### Alternatives

- **Options Considered**: Were reasonable alternatives evaluated?
- **Rationale**: Is the chosen approach well-justified?
- **Trade-offs**: Are the trade-offs acknowledged and documented?

### Implementation

- **Testing**: Is there a comprehensive testing strategy?
- **Documentation**: Will documentation be updated?
- **Migration**: Is there a clear migration path (if breaking)?
- **Timeline**: Is the implementation plan realistic?

---

## Decision Process

### Reviewers

FEPs are reviewed by:
- **Framework maintainers**: Core Victor team
- **Vertical developers**: Authors of affected verticals
- **Community members**: Anyone interested in the proposal

### Decision Making

FEP decisions are made by consensus among maintainers:

1. **Review period concludes** (minimum 14 days)
2. **Maintainers discuss** the FEP in a dedicated meeting or async discussion
3. **Consensus is reached**:
   - **Accept**: Proceed to implementation
   - **Reject**: Document rationale and close
   - **Request Changes**: Return to author for revisions
   - **Defer**: Postpone for future consideration

### Acceptance

A FEP is accepted when:
- All review criteria are met
- Maintainers reach consensus
- No outstanding blocking objections
- Acceptance criteria are clearly defined

### Rejection

A FEP is rejected when:
- Fundamental technical flaws are identified
- The proposal doesn't align with Victor's direction
- The costs outweigh the benefits
- An alternative approach is strongly preferred

**Note**: Rejection is not a judgment of quality or effort. Rejected FEPs remain in the repository as a record of the discussion.

---

## Implementation

### After Acceptance

Once a FEP is accepted:

1. **Assign Implementation Owner**: Who will implement this?
2. **Create Tracking Issue**: GitHub issue to track implementation progress
3. **Start Implementation**: Following the phases in the FEP
4. **Update FEP Status**: Change to "Implemented" when complete

### Implementation Requirements

Before marking a FEP as "Implemented", ensure:

- [ ] Code is implemented per specification
- [ ] Tests have >80% coverage
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Migration guide is provided (if breaking)
- [ ] Changelog entry is added
- [ ] Release notes are prepared
- [ ] Backward compatibility is verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are run (if applicable)

### Deviating from the FEP

If implementation reveals issues requiring deviation:

1. **Document the deviation**: Explain why
2. **Update the FEP**: Create an amendment or revision
3. **Get approval**: Maintainers must approve significant deviations
4. **Update status**: Note the changes in the "Review Process" section

---
