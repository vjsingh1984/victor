# Research Vertical

The Research vertical provides web research, fact-checking, literature synthesis, and report generation capabilities. It is designed to compete with Perplexity AI, Google Gemini Deep Research, and ChatGPT Browse.

## Overview

The Research vertical (`victor/research/`) is specialized for web research tasks. Unlike coding assistants that focus on local codebases, the Research vertical searches the internet, fetches web pages, synthesizes information from multiple sources, and provides researched answers with citations.

### Key Use Cases

- **Deep Research**: Multi-source research with verification and synthesis
- **Fact-Checking**: Systematic claim verification with evidence evaluation
- **Literature Review**: Academic literature discovery and analysis
- **Competitive Analysis**: Market and competitor research
- **Quick Research**: Fast answers for simple queries
- **Report Generation**: Structured research documents with citations

## Available Tools

The Research vertical uses the following tools from `victor.tools.tool_names`:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `web_search` | Search the internet for information |
| `web_fetch` | Fetch and read content from URLs |
| `read` | Read local files and reports |
| `write` | Write research reports |
| `edit` | Modify existing documents |
| `ls` | List directory contents |
| `grep` | Search through documents |

## Best Practices

1. **Use multiple sources**: Cross-reference claims across independent sources
2. **Verify credibility**: Check author authority and publication reputation
3. **Note recency**: Prefer recent sources for time-sensitive topics
4. **Cite everything**: Always attribute information to sources
5. **Acknowledge uncertainty**: Be transparent about limitations
6. **Distinguish facts from opinions**: Clearly separate factual claims
7. **Update findings**: Research can become outdated quickly

## Research Quality Standards

When conducting research:

- **Source Quality**: Prioritize authoritative sources (academic papers, official docs, reputable news)
- **Verification**: Cross-reference claims across multiple independent sources
- **Attribution**: Always cite sources with URLs or references
- **Objectivity**: Present balanced views, note controversies and limitations
- **Recency**: Prefer recent sources for time-sensitive topics

## Output Format

Research reports follow this structure:

1. **Executive Summary**: Key findings at a glance
2. **Introduction and Background**: Context for the research question
3. **Methodology**: Sources consulted and evaluation criteria
4. **Findings**: Organized by theme with citations
5. **Analysis and Discussion**: Interpretation of findings
6. **Conclusions**: Summary of insights
7. **Recommendations**: Action items if applicable
8. **References**: Full bibliography in requested format
9. **Limitations**: Areas needing further research

## Ethical Considerations

- **Never fabricate sources or statistics**
- **Acknowledge uncertainty when information is unclear**
- **Distinguish between facts, analysis, and opinions**
- **Update findings when new information emerges**
- **Respect copyright and fair use**
- **Disclose potential conflicts of interest**
