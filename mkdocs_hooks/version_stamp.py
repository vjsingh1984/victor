"""MkDocs hook: single-source the docs version stamp from the ``VERSION`` file.

Replaces the literal token ``{{ victor_version }}`` in page markdown with the victor-ai release
version (read once from the repo-root ``VERSION``) at build time.

This is a *targeted string replace*, not a Jinja pass (i.e. not mkdocs-macros): the docs contain
~40 literal ``{{ ... }}`` examples (cookiecutter trees, Cypher queries, workflow prompts) that a
full macro/Jinja pass would mangle, so we deliberately substitute only this one token and leave
everything else untouched. Result: bump ``VERSION`` and every doc stamp updates — one source.
