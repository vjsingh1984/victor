"""Conversation management protocol for vertical extensions.

Defines the contract that vertical-specific conversation managers
must implement. External verticals should depend on this protocol
rather than importing internal coordinator classes.

Usage::

    from victor_sdk.verticals.protocols.conversation import (
        ConversationManagerProtocol,
    )

    class MyConversationManager:
        '''Implements ConversationManagerProtocol.'''

        def add_message(self, role: str, content: str, **metadata):
            ...
