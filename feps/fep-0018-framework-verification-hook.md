# FEP-0018: Framework verification hook

## Summary

Add a **framework-level verification hook** to the agentic loop: after the agent claims COMPLETE, run a pluggable `Verifier` that checks the agent's work against real-world feedback (tests, lint, dry-run). If verification fails, inject the result as feedback and re-enter the loop (bounded retries). Today this capability is **eval-only** (the benchmark adapter's verify-and-retry gate). FEP-0018 promotes it to the loop itself so ANY agent session benefits.

## Motivation

The verify-and-retry capability proved its value in SWE-bench eval: it achieved **97/97 VERIFIED** on one astropy task — the agent saw "9/10 tests passed, test_foo failed", fixed it on retry, and achieved a full pass. But:
- It lives in `agent_adapter.py` (eval-only) — interactive chat, workflows, CLI get no verification.
- It's wired by `benchmark.py`'s verify_fn closure — SWE-bench-specific.
- `StreamingChatExecutor` has no verify gate at all.

FEP-0018 promotes the capability to the agentic loop's DECIDE phase, making it available to every agent session.

## Proposed Change

### `Verifier` protocol (`victor/framework/verification.py`)
A `@runtime_checkable` Protocol with `async def verify(*, workspace, state) -> VerificationResult`. `VerificationResult` carries `passed/total/raw_output/feedback` + an `is_verified` property. Zero victor deps (stdlib only).

### Verify gate in the DECIDE phase (`victor/framework/agentic_loop.py`)
After DECIDE=COMPLETE + backslide guard, before break/return:
```python
if (evaluation.decision == COMPLETE
        and getattr(self, "_verifier", None) is not None
        and getattr(self, "_verify_retries", 0) < getattr(self, "_max_verify_retries", 0)):
    vr = await self._run_verification(state)
    if not vr.is_verified:
        self._inject_verify_feedback(vr)
        self._verify_retries += 1
        continue  # re-enter the loop
```
Added to BOTH `run()` and `run_streaming()`. Uses `getattr` for bare-instance robustness.

### Loop constructor: `verifier` + `max_verify_retries` params
```python
AgenticLoop(..., verifier: Optional[Verifier] = None, max_verify_retries: int = 0)
```
Default None/0 = no behavior change (fully backward-compatible).

### Helpers: `_run_verification` + `_inject_verify_feedback`
- `_run_verification(state)`: calls `self._verifier.verify(workspace=..., state=state)`, returns `VerificationResult`.
- `_inject_verify_feedback(result)`: injects the result as a user message via `turn_executor._chat_context.add_message()` (mirrors `_inject_decide_nudges`).

## Benefits

- **Any agent session** can now verify + retry, not just benchmark eval.
- **Streaming parity**: `run_streaming()` gets the verify gate for free (it's in the loop, not the adapter).
- **Pluggable**: any `Verifier` implementation (container test, local test, lint, dry-run, citation-check) can be wired without loop changes.
- **Backward-compatible**: `verifier=None` (default) = zero behavior change.

## Drawbacks and Alternatives

- **Wiring complexity**: the verifier must be threaded through the orchestrator → turn_executor → AgenticLoop injection path. Phase 1 lands the protocol + loop gate (backward-compatible); Phase 2 wires the SWE-bench verifier + removes the adapter's duplicate gate.
- **Alternative considered**: keep verification in the adapter (status quo). Rejected: the adapter is eval-specific; the capability is generic.
- **Alternative considered**: a separate "verification middleware." Rejected: the DECIDE gate is the natural place (it's where the loop decides to exit); a middleware adds indirection.

## Unresolved Questions

- **Verifier injection path**: how to thread the verifier from SessionConfig/profile → AgenticLoop for non-eval sessions (interactive chat, workflows). Phase 2.
- **Adaptive retry budget**: should `max_verify_retries` adapt based on progress (more retries for near-misses like 23/24)? Phase 3.
- **Multi-verifier composition**: should multiple verifiers run in sequence (test + lint + type-check)? Phase 3.

## Implementation Plan

- **Phase 1 (this PR)**: Protocol + loop gate (run + run_streaming) + helpers. Backward-compatible (verifier=None default). The adapter's existing gate stays until Phase 2.
- **Phase 2 (follow-up)**: Migrate the SWE-bench verifier as `ContainerTestVerifier(Verifier)`. Wire the benchmark to pass it to the loop. Remove the adapter's duplicate gate (one gate, not two).
- **Phase 3 (follow-up)**: Generic verifiers (LocalTestVerifier, LintVerifier, DryRunVerifier) + SessionConfig/CLI surface (`--verify` flag) + adaptive retry budget.

## Migration Path

Additive and non-breaking. The protocol + loop gate are dormant by default (verifier=None). The adapter's existing gate continues to work. Phase 2 migrates the SWE-bench path to the loop gate.

## Compatibility

- No public API change (new optional params, new module).
- All existing tests pass (91 unit + 28 streaming parity batteries verified).
- The adapter's verify gate (agent_adapter.py:1309-1338) is unchanged in Phase 1.
