# FEP-0008: Evaluation-Centric Completion

## Summary

Replace Victor's heuristic completion/EVALUATE decision with an **evaluation-centric** one:
task-adaptive **rubric** dimensions scored with confidence and gated by a **DimensionAwareFilter**
(AdaRubric `2603.21362`); a **verifiable-effect** precondition before any COMPLETE (HarnessFix
`2606.06324` "completion-without-effect"); an **online per-turn auditor** that flags the decisive
error before it cascades (AgentForesight `2605.08715`); and a **judge-reliability harness** that
gates whether any LLM-as-judge is trusted at all (AgentProp-Bench `2604.16706`). A
**trajectory-level evaluation harness** (TRBench `2604.08178`) extends `victor/evaluation/` so these
changes are measured, not assumed.

This supersedes the heuristic stack the FEP-0007 cutover left in `AgenticLoop._evaluate`
(`EnhancedCompletionEvaluator` scalar + the `forced_task_completion` marker signal + the
`_is_terminal_answer` override) with one calibrated, explainable decision — keeping those as the
behavioral baseline the new path must match-or-beat on the acceptance batteries.

**Benefits**: Replacing heuristics with calibrated, multi-dimensional scoring eliminates false
completion signals, reduces restatement loops, and provides explainable decisions grounded in
verifiable effects. The judge-reliability gate prevents untrusted LLM-as-judge calls, and the
trajectory-level harness enables measurement-driven optimization rather than assumption-driven
development.

**Cost impact**: Minimal due to per-task-family rubric caching (>95% cost reduction per AdaRubric)
and edge-model auditing. The effect gate reuses existing verification tools.

## Motivation

The FEP-0007 live verification exposed the core defect: `EnhancedCompletionEvaluator` scores a
*complete* answer at ~0.26–0.41 ("insufficient progress"), so the loop burns low-confidence retries
and the model restates its answer until the iteration cap. We patched it twice (a HIGH-confidence
active-marker signal; a `_is_terminal_answer` heuristic). Both work, but they are heuristics on a
heuristic, and **nothing measures whether completion judgments are actually correct.**

Specific gaps (grounded against the code):

- **Scalar, static completion.** A single fused score can't express "the answer is correct but the
  recovery was poor"; one strong axis masks a failed one.
- **No effect grounding.** Completion is asserted from text; an agent can `complete` without a
  verifiable workspace delta (HarnessFix's "completion-without-effect"; Harness-Bench's
  "execution-alignment failure").
- **Post-hoc failure handling.** Spin/repetition/plateau are detected *after* the loop is already
  stuck; there is no per-turn "is this prefix heading for failure?" signal.
- **Unvalidated judges.** Substring/keyword completion checks agree with humans at κ≈0.05 (chance,
  AgentProp-Bench). Victor has *no* judge-reliability measurement anywhere.
- **No trajectory-level eval.** `AgenticExecutionTrace` exists offline but the loop's online control
  uses heuristic scores; there is no harness scoring *full trajectories* on planning / tool-grounding
  / recovery / refusal with confidence intervals.

## Benefits

**Calibrated completion decisions**: Rubric-based scoring with confidence intervals replaces
opaque scalar scores, providing explainable decisions for each completion judgement. Users
and developers can see exactly which dimensions passed/failed and why.

**Reduced restatement loops**: The DimensionAwareFilter prevents premature completion from one
strong signal masking weak ones, while also avoiding the under-scoring problem that causes
valid answers to be marked incomplete and restated.

**Verifiable effects before completion**: The effect gate ensures the agent never declares
COMPLETE without a verifiable workspace delta or passed check, eliminating "completion-without-effect"
failures where the model claims success but makes no changes.

**Early failure detection**: The per-turn auditor flags problematic trajectories before they
cascade into spin/repetition loops, enabling intervention at the point of deviation rather than
after wasting tokens.

**Judge reliability gating**: The Krippendorff α / Cohen κ gate ensures no LLM-as-judge is
trusted in production without demonstrated reliability, preventing biased or inconsistent
judgments from affecting real behavior.

**Measurement-driven optimization**: The trajectory-level harness provides confidence-interval-
bounded scores on planning, tool-grounding, recovery, and refusal, enabling data-driven decisions
rather than assumptions.

## Design principles

- **One decision point.** All signals resolve inside `AgenticLoop._evaluate` → `EvaluationResult`.
  No new control-flow path; the streaming loop inherits this via the shared `_evaluate` (FEP-0007).
- **Cache to keep it cheap.** Rubrics are generated once per *task family* and cached (>95% cost cut
  per AdaRubric); the online auditor is a single small-model call on the prefix.
- **Gated by the acceptance oracle.** Every change ships behind the parity + characterization
  batteries (FEP-0007) plus the new judge-agreement metric; see Acceptance Criteria.
- **Fail safe toward not-stopping-early.** The DimensionAwareFilter + effect gate make premature
  completion *harder*, not easier; the auditor only raises alarms, never force-completes.

## Proposed Change

### Phase A — Rubric-based completion evaluator (AdaRubric)

Introduce `RubricCompletionEvaluator` in `victor/framework/` implementing the existing completion
seam consumed by `_evaluate`:

1. **Generate** a rubric `R(task)` = N≈4–6 orthogonal dimensions (e.g. Correctness, Tool-Grounding,
   Error-Recovery, Completeness), each with a weight and calibrated 5-point criteria. Validate
   (pairwise cosine-distance > 0.3; weights sum to 1). **Cache per task family** (keyed by the
   existing `TaskAnalyzer` task type/signature).
2. **Score** the turn/trajectory per dimension with a confidence `c∈[0,1]` (low when the turn doesn't
   engage that dimension). Aggregate via confidence-weighted mean (default), geometric mean
   (balanced), or min (safety).
3. **DimensionAwareFilter** — require `s̄ⱼ ≥ θⱼ` for *every* dimension before COMPLETE; otherwise
   CONTINUE/RETRY with the failing dimension as the reason. This is the structural fix for "one
   strong signal triggers premature stop" *and* "a finished answer is under-scored overall."

`EnhancedCompletionEvaluator` remains as a fallback and as the baseline the rubric path must
match-or-beat on the batteries; selection via `settings.evaluation.completion_strategy`
(`rubric` | `enhanced` | `legacy`) — a strategy setting, not a feature flag, consistent with the
prompt-optimization settings pattern.

### Phase B — Effect-grounded completion gate (HarnessFix / Harness-Bench)

Before returning COMPLETE, require a **verifiable effect**: a workspace artifact/state delta or a
passed check, sourced from `victor/tools/verification/` (claim verifier / cross-reference) and the
turn's `tool_results`. A COMPLETE with no observable effect is downgraded to RETRY with a
"completion-without-effect" reason. For pure Q&A tasks (no expected mutation), the "effect" is a
grounded-claim check, not a file delta. Wired as a precondition inside `_evaluate`, reusing the
existing `is_qa_response` / task-type signals to choose the effect class.

### Phase C — Online per-turn auditor (AgentForesight)

Add `TurnAuditor`: a cheap, prefix-only `f(trajectory[:k]) → {CONTINUE | ALARM(step, reason)}` run
each turn inside the loop (and the streaming `_stream_turn` ACT/EVALUATE band). On ALARM, the loop
opens an intervention window (replan / nudge / escalate via the existing `NudgePolicy` /
`RecoveryService`) instead of waiting for spin detection to trip post-hoc. Backed by the edge model
(`use_edge_model`); falls back to the existing spin/repetition guards when unavailable.

### Phase D — Judge-reliability harness (AgentProp-Bench)

Before any LLM-as-judge (rubric scoring, trajectory grading) is *trusted in production*, it must pass
a reliability gate: ship a small human-labeled trajectory set under `tests/` /
`victor/evaluation/judge_calibration/`, compute **Krippendorff α / Cohen κ** vs the labels, and
require α ≥ 0.7 (configurable) to enable the judge; otherwise fall back to algorithmic scoring. Use a
small **order-swap ensemble** (≥2 reorderings) to defuse position/verbosity bias. Track **rejection**
(catch bad input) and **recovery** (fix after accepting) as *separate* metrics — they are
statistically independent.

### Phase E — Trajectory-level evaluation harness (TRBench)

Extend `victor/evaluation/` with a `trajectory_eval/` harness that scores *full trajectories*
(reusing `AgenticExecutionTrace`) on Planning, Tool-Grounding, Recovery, and Refusal, with
length-balanced cases and **confidence intervals** on reported scores (`2605.10448`). This is the
measurement substrate for Phases A–D and feeds the acceptance oracle (P5 / ADR-012).

## Implementation Plan

Each phase is independently landable, behavior-gated, and reversible.

- **Phase A1** — `RubricCompletionEvaluator` + per-task-family rubric cache; offline unit tests with
  scripted dimensions. *No wiring.*
- **Phase A2** — wire into `_evaluate` behind `completion_strategy="rubric"`; default stays
  `enhanced`. Run batteries + judge-agreement on the labeled set; flip default only if match-or-beat.
- **Phase B** — effect-grounded gate (independent of A; benefits all strategies).
- **Phase C** — `TurnAuditor` (edge-model), additive; nudge/replan on ALARM.
- **Phase D** — judge-reliability harness + α/κ gate (prerequisite to trusting A/E judges).
- **Phase E** — trajectory eval harness (can land first as pure measurement; recommended early).

Recommended order for *measurement-first* discipline: **E → D → A → B → C.**

## Unresolved Questions

1. **Rubric calibration across domains**: How many per-task-family rubrics are needed? AdaRubric
   shows >95% cache hit for similar tasks, but the diversity of Victor workflows needs empirical
   validation.

2. **Judge agreement thresholds**: Is α ≥ 0.7 the right gate? AgentProp-Bench shows human-LLM agreement
   varies widely by task type; we may need per-category thresholds.

3. **Effect definition for Q&A tasks**: For pure question-answering, "verifiable effect" needs a
   grounded definition. Is a claim-verification check sufficient, or do we need external grounding?

4. **Auditor latency budget**: The per-turn auditor adds one edge-model call per turn. Is the
   latency acceptable for interactive use, or should we batch audits every N turns?

5. **Trajectory eval coverage**: TRBench provides trajectory-level scoring, but which failure modes
   should it prioritize? Planning errors vs tool misuse vs recovery failure vs refusal quality?

## Migration Path

**Phase 1 (Pre-cutover)**: Deploy `RubricCompletionEvaluator` and trajectory harness behind
feature flags. Run A/B tests against `EnhancedCompletionEvaluator` baseline on existing traces.
Establish judge-agreement metrics (α/κ) on the labeled trajectory set.

**Phase 2 (Limited rollout)**: Enable rubric-based completion for opt-in users via
`completion_strategy="rubric"` setting. Monitor restatement rate, completion latency, and
user-reported completion accuracy. Collect production traces for calibration.

**Phase 3 (Judge gating)**: Once α ≥ 0.7 is achieved on the human-labeled set, enable
judge-reliability gate for all rubric scoring. Roll out TurnAuditor for early failure detection.

**Phase 4 (Effect gate)**: Deploy verifiable-effect precondition for all completion strategies.
Start with code-generation tasks (file effects are clear), extend to Q&A (claim verification).

**Phase 5 (Default cutover)**: After parity battery passes with confidence intervals,
flip default `completion_strategy` from `"enhanced"` to `"rubric"`. Keep enhanced as fallback.

**Rollback**: All phases are gated by `settings.evaluation.completion_strategy` and existing
feature flags. Instant rollback by flipping the setting or disabling flags.

## Compatibility

**Existing deployments**: No breaking changes. The new evaluator is opt-in via settings; existing
behavior is preserved under `completion_strategy="enhanced"` (current default).

**Plugin compatibility**: Tools exposing completion signals (e.g., custom verification tools)
work unchanged. The effect gate uses existing `tool_results` and verification interfaces.

**Provider compatibility**: All providers benefit from calibrated completion; no provider-specific
changes required. Judge calls use the existing provider abstraction.

**Streaming parity**: FEP-0007 unified loop ensures streaming and buffered paths share the
`_evaluate` seam; rubric-based completion applies to both without separate implementation.

**API compatibility**: No public API changes. `victor/evaluation/` extensions remain compatible;
new trajectory harness is additive, not a replacement.

## Acceptance criteria

- **Parity battery 14/14 and characterization battery byte-stable-or-justified** (FEP-0007 gate) for
  every phase that touches `_evaluate` / `_stream_turn`.
- **Judge agreement reported** (Krippendorff α / κ) on the human-labeled set; the rubric judge is
  enabled only at α ≥ threshold.
- **Restatement metric down** vs the FEP-0007 baseline on the live multi-step task (the observable
  the cutover fix targeted) — measured, not assumed.
- **No premature completion regression**: the multi-step parity scenarios keep their full tool
  sequences; the DimensionAwareFilter + effect gate must not stop before the task's effect exists.
- Eval results reported with confidence intervals at *(model, completion_strategy)* granularity.

## Drawbacks and Alternatives

- **Cost/latency of a judge per turn.** Mitigated by per-task-family rubric caching, a small edge
  auditor, and the α-gate (don't run an untrusted judge). Alternative — keep the algorithmic
  evaluator — is the status quo whose under-scoring this FEP exists to fix.
- **Premature completion risk** from a new gate. Mitigated structurally: the filter + effect gate
  make stopping *harder*; the auditor never force-completes.
- **Behavior change to the shared loop** (buffered + streaming). Mitigated by the strategy setting
  (default unchanged until proven) and the acceptance batteries.
