"""SDK Tool Contract — declarable, stable tool metadata (FEP-0009).

External, SDK-first verticals import only ``victor_contracts``; this module gives them a
stable, **data-only** way to declare a tool's traits (``access_mode``, ``danger_level``,
``execution_category``, ``cost_tier``, ``category``, plus selection hints) without
importing ``victor.tools.*`` (a boundary violation). The framework's
``victor.tools.contract.resolve_contract`` bridges a declared :class:`ToolContract` into
the richer internal ``victor.tools.metadata.ToolMetadata`` at unchanged precedence.

Design (FEP-0009, Phase 1):
- **Data-only**: no imports from ``victor.*`` (only the in-package ``CapabilityContract``).
- **Frozen + tuples**: the contract is hashable and immutable, safe to share.
- **``str``-valued enums** whose values mirror the framework enums exactly, so the bridge
  maps by value and the wire form is plain strings tolerant of version skew.
- **Declarable intent only**: ranking/loop-detection knobs (priority, mandatory_keywords,
  signature_params) deliberately stay internal — see FEP-0009 Q2.
